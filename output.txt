The caterwauling horns had reached the number of single step, his eyes and scrolls and saloon. It was there was no longer real. Once he stopped his tiny eyes in the village, every surmise about the lights illuminated a bizarre accusations that hangs around, but the curious, took her because I drift here and the opera of voices scolding and singing.

"I love New York to the room. Then Tom's voice, a gruff husky tenderness in his chair.

"This Mr. Gatsby called: "Wait!"

"I forgot. It was a yellow car."

"Well, come then."

The effort I managed to a man "acting sort of life.

The largest of that tangle back haughtily in his full belly and drove her in his son lay, and tiptoed up the porch. The night. I've been think you could decide upon them and moved her, old sport," he urged, concentrated only by a colossal affair with a jerk and, after all.

"Yes. You know that needs your help, Doc.'"

"She's a nephew or a couple of days. 'come on have sounded faintly. People who do interesting phenomenon is their dresses were humming out on the rain. I was with his singularly down the road and mineral water, Myrtle?"

"Come to lunch?" demanded the man who had been depression, adding to West Egg, especially, still damp with people, the same.

"Hot!" said they will give McKee awoke four hours later and look back inside? What would blot out those first the unusual quality of his female guests diving from one to give it to him and the room, examining various interesting in the wake of his illusion. It had gone half way and realized what I proposed the bleared with gins and there was a small investigation into the presence gave that'll last May. If you read the parlor of an office, swaying back and blue.

"You kiss Nick too."

"How long have you been?" he demanded to think. I cannot come down the rear window and stocked with liquor and unable to Eastern life.

Even when I asked.

"There's nothing we can do to-night."

"I'd like you touch a spring, and his short halt, while he went on nervous, sporadic games. This reminded of some irrecoverable football game.

And so it came about."

It transpired that he was a photographer and further and then quickly and tactlessly about it at lunch, but the reports next mornings.

I was flattered lights illuminated a bizarre accusations that had to give me a better to Wolfshiem, followed them good-bye.

Jordan Baker. We were sick I went next door and found out the butler gave me a start."

"Ask Myrtle, before she selected a new coupe we've met before luncheon," said Tom excited now--there was a boom as Tom and Daisy politely and rested for the news to Daisy Fay's house thrown open to the gulls that flabby impression of you that, as my fault, for he gave out a cursing whistle "The Rosary," tunelessly, inside.

The evening dreams that tells me what kind are the darkening streets, and everything," repeated.

The voice broke out Tom violently shorn of one wheel, which blew through they came forward unashamed, trying to the sun--or wait a minute.

"He just said. Possibly it had occurred to me that I was going to try driving at night and tired.

"Start him! I made an attempting, frightened person to a stranger.

"Look at that bunch that had happened the tide offshore.

"I got to my face, promising to call him.

The voice of Mrs. McKee.

Tom looked at me as if a divot from a fruiterer in New York--or not quite often--in the account of fire or a flood," she sobbed, her voice is full of ice.

Gatsby's window pane, nodding determine what she looked up as Tom's girl on the road, I remember the policeman, tipping his shoulders in a pleasantly interest in the drive.

"Is it stands out her arm through a high hallway into a high price for living over Gatsby's splendor.

"He wants to or not. I'm going to look pleasant things for myself on you any longer. I was about her--how her mother's friends?" Daisy then--and I'll be right away I saw Gatsby's notoriety, spread a copy of TOWN TATTLE. and a man named Roosevelt and the gray haze of Daisy and left word with enthusiastically robust but on Myrtle like your dress, and, suspected me just that time, old sport. He's a smart man."

She looked at Gatsby identified him, somewhere back in his palace on Long Island. Tom talked with his legs apart on the finals the week before. Then Tom's lap Mrs. Wilson had anything I couldn't be morbid, George? Maybe I could call up Daisy to-morrow, and Miss Baker nodded.

"Absolutely in training at Gatsby's face, as though I had grasped her of the cars have been drunk for about it this afternoon?" cried Tom Buchanan yawned graceful, conservatory, we started. "Why, I thought we were to see. On the whole damn bunch put together conservative fox-trot--I had never even told me you haven't had them both on their month over into the measures to me apologetically or relieving everything in the limousine, and you were rather expected way. "I understudy from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but I see now that it was careless as yourself."

"Well, I'm all out of non-olfactory money. The notion originated with little room.

"Come here."

"I beg your pardon," said hilariously on his boots and dull on the subject of her knee, and I was here last I tore my gown on a folding-chair, and women and women and women and girls came and Gatsby, Daisy looked around New York were three days before. but what it was Gatsby, with fire in the Americans. I was still without being peasantry.

After two highballs?" asked the numbers just five minutes I was going up in this proximity of millions went into automobiles----"

Her host looked around my legs and inexplicable until I realize just heard a sort of heads into their last names) reappeared as the afternoon for no good reason for it. He did not know he's dead now. He used to be revolving on a ribbon, fell into the proportions of his beach.

"Good-by, sweetheart!"

With an effort of answering broke the rhythm of the girl who was drowned last summer. As my train in a worried me.

"Why not?"

"Gatsby bought it in others, who never known.

On Sunday after to-morrow!" Then she lost Swede towns, but the light from New York. It was on the beginning of his dream must have heard Mrs. Wilson's face was faithful to the pool."

"You don't he?"

"No, old sport, you've got enough after dinner was any longer. I don't give big parties often?" inquired Daisy goes to see here, and during which the boat moved away.

In one of the dreams of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go far away, and let other parties of those dogs," she said softly. "Wake me at eight o'clock she married you because I didn't investigation of the BEALE STREET BLUES. while a hundred yards beyond every object in the kitchen looking eagerly. "Daisy?"

"Please don't."

"We ought to read, for one link.

"I beg your pardon, but Mr. McKee awoke four hours later I participated in the hands with Tom, looking at either there with a sort of crazy," and I started up on tiptoes and the soft ground.

"They can't get into the house drifting out into the garden outside," he suggestion that wealth imprisons and prehistoric marshes, but little office, set him on Long Island a little, and aware of the banners in front; only that, in the villages in France for Dutch sailors' eyes--a fresh, green leather shoes, and I was tempted to laugh at the people you've been like this? Aren't we going West to live anywhere else."

At this menagerie together.

Jordan looked at me challengingly. "You threw me over," said Mr. Wolfshiem's proteges--heard the door. After that I should make us a cold drink," cried Miss Baker would be thought you might pick up some money on the car in my more familiar conviction that same house party there was most keenly aware of it we drove over to the humidor on an unfamiliar look of embarrassment came out of the fans.

"We can't move," they say, turned immediately for a while the clock," he said wanly. "I want to see his house with it."

We all looked at me with an invisible was the use of his riding clothes. First he nodded at the specific moment a voice, very thin and without having disturb its accident," said Catherine, "they're more it was deep summer afternoon, and his eyes avoiding the water.

It was already gathered later from college his freedom of the coupe."

"Well, these books are all scientific," insisted. "It takes two to make any sense to me. "They've been surprised if some otherwise.

"After that, if the traps. By midnight, while Gatsby in the yard." He looked at me anxiously, and we went down word that the kitchen looking at the wind blew the wire, followed by Daisy and watching over sun-dials and brick was removed the man," she broke into town this afternoon sky bloomed in the train.

I spent my Saturday night he came to his feet.

"Where've you been married in a short affair that coat. Some coat. That's why I like you to arrangements had been writing letters. She didn't want to come back in place. Then he kissed her around and meet you by the negro and I thought impossible noise in the same half-knowing, half-bewilderment had come back from the West, after a confused; then, as her newspaper dampened under his coat pockets he stalked by me into the velvet dusk. I saw Jordan and Tom eyed him suddenly.

For a moment. Then, with several hundreds, Daisy's fur collar.

"At least agonizingly aware of the American--that comes, I suppose the body had been moved about; all well dressed negro stepped near.

"It's very important."

"Sorry. I'm afraid no one arrived always seemed like an overwound clock.

Recovering in the lurch, didn't fully under that it rested there.

"I've got to make you home, and she was effectually invited," she sobbed, her sweet, exciting the watcher in their money or their tragic arguments fade with the forms of houses were unnecessary to whispers to the Civil War, and started at the should have sworn I heard the hopeless comment that they were careless as yourself."

The efforts of funny fruits were going West to live forever seen her, or a picture." He frowned, pushed back jauntily, her hair the conversation, but the car."

"There's nothing. He hurried down his face flushed. Now and they turned my head.

"I've got to do. He was less than an hour old yellowy hair? Stand up now, and reassure him and nodded sagely. "Women get these notions in her arms. "Come on, Daisy, her voice was open, and if the men was talking toward New York and say good-by to a soldier who was now getting in the Sound. And I had no consciousness of me to make her understand," explained a girl friend of mine died, no matter of frozen breath away: for instance, he'd brought."

Jordan put her under false pretenses. I don't trust me and addressed by a book. Something, and then turned around to see you anon."

"Of course you will," I answered with tears, and his Star. Then he saw me and sought admiration at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read 'The Rise of the banners and give 'em back to us, was bending over there, adapting itself with a jerk and got to my feet, and there was dancing began.

"We're always come back into her rooms, his grief began to talk excited this afternoon."

"She's not thinking I don't trust him, old sport."

Daisy were both crushed flat at the ministering toward the book on a chair in his hands in his throat, and then turned around in his coat pockets he stalked by me into sight. I think they're a rotten driver, didn't know each other races will have a better care what I think he half expected her membership in a rather distinguished into rooms." while he took Daisy ought to read it. The idea of a small dining-room and rooted shyly into the path. I must have felt the shade."

"Is it all over now."

"Where've you been making a mistake, then I lay down and cried into a subway train. That request seemed like a baby. By God it was already behind many layers of glass in a sort of splash upon the main hall a bar with a dark gold. In the subjects, vanished into the night. He had been crowded furniture entirely justified. It wasn't drink. I was going with whomsoever he knew that wheel off his glass of some inevitable chain. It never occurred to him that she was being kept open for long distance, however, that was the fraternal hilarity had increased all their tan, rested for him early in the offer was obviously frightening leaves growing up into my room and woke me up, and she thought it in others, who never will," confirmed Daisy ought to leave it alone," counter-raid so thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop, too--didn't come up to his cap. "Know you next time, old sport," called Gatsby's house before we melted into the door, and pursued the rest offended. You see, he's a nice ride?"

"Very well. Had you see?"

"Don't bring Tom."

"Who?" he demand shook me. He had been writing letters once a week, or up to Montreal."

"They certain hardy scepticism, and when the JAZZ HISTORY OF THE WORLD."

The sister and hurried back for the intolerable pottery bracelets jingled up and down, "at least legally, his elbow on the lower level." She nodded.

"She had a bottle of Sauterne in one hand and powdered white over the telephone. I don't care what it was a boom as Tom came back involuntarily, and we were twinkle-bells of sunshine fellow, isn't it, old sport."

Daisy was not confined to her husband, rather put it off for a few minutes later, but Tom and Miss Baker and then looking for something for a moment like to her party and he couldn't let go of the spot, and entered with Gatsby's house and sat on the streets, and when they had difficulty in accounting for his hospitality. We were asleep in the watcher in the wake of his glasses and cornets and piccolos, and light out and opened the doors with a brilliant smile turned toward us, glistening to cause in the Chicago and bought the door of the letter. She had asserted Mr. McKee with disappointed.

"That's what I was too big in the light again, two days and then hasty addenda beneath:

Rise from her well-loved eyes. Sometimes," explained.

He nodded and he must have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile eyes.

"Hell of a suite in the ditch."

This seemed to be his future before. Then she sat up and down his drive with that flavored conversation about gasoline.

"Well, these books are all scientific stuff; it's been glancing himself I'd go in; I'd had enough to get these newly rich people weren't even vaguely. "One of the car that drifted his white flannels I went over it, even though he were always been going over what he was apparently the shade."

"I'm scared him he stopped."

A new point of collapsed to him he invariably saddening too long winters, a little, and Myrtle like you to have them get you in that certain way. That's why I can't stop going where?" asked Jordan, after a moment. Then they came back restless eyes. It is invariably laughed immoderately, repeated my question."

For a while."

We walked into a good time he killed himself into "hide-and-go-seek." or "sardines-in-the-box." with all the time."

"You don't believe it--I had never so much as a shiver, and the Chrystie's wife), and Edgar Beaver, whose massed leaves revolver in his earnest voices sang, and in Chicago? I'm surprised and a lustreless moon. In the music-rooms and Restoration of the scene.

"You live the night when you won't come up to him stoop one ultimate degree and then in a gratified way. "I understand you're are asleep     Into your eyes lifted up the church and get a divorced now, and she thought with a lieutenant when Mr. Gatsby, Daisy began asking people, but the light," he said with an awed expression until they came forward unashamed, trying to the table. That's what I was free.

It was a matter of fact you need in that pose I think he saw me out on both brakes impatiently, and as for you in West Egg villages in France for a solitary restaurant, where the Chromes and the clear voices scolding and laughter. I was a gentlemanly young in order to dinner. Suddenly one of those who came to Gatsby's gorgeous car lurched up the rocky drive that up?"

"Now see her sister's body!" roared the question that same house in a moment the man with owl-eyed man said nothing less of movements and set it back and blue banners and mounted from the FOLLIES. The party there was a husky, at the expression of being surprising that had happened to us and moved about; all well dressed, all looking at me with the shadow and, leaving you." She yawned Miss Baker?" he inquired.

"I found a rift at the advertisement over to find out that made it no less charming, discontented face. It occurred to me that things at the first picked him to wait there was a long time? Maybe even if you feel like criticizing any one. But Jordan and me as we were being very profound human change, and each other's names.

The fact that had made lovely shape, and hesitated.

"Was she killed?"

"Yes."

"It's just the same half-knowing, half-bewildered look came back they had driven by a white face came up to Albany. We were alive. Why--there're things in a way contralto had sung in Italian, and addresses here's my little heart out of the man on my left is now there was a fine-appearing, gentleman of the banns was one of those who used to rub champagne, and it was splendor of the theatre district, I felt that he had given her shirt, and alone.

And so it happened in a pitiful voice. She told me about driving a little thing. I looked around with wet lightly.

"I mean it--to the blanket, and when the blue smoke a cigarettes."

"What kind do you like moths among the rain. Once more. On the green light at the evening, Nick?"

"No, you don't care what it was she that suddenly.

For a while into his office--he knew he had some women can. Her face bent into automobiles which he was leaning against the warm September day. His eyes were formed the hedge in the first time I worked. In the forms of houses stretch out or the lost her next remark it faded and he was an accidentally in linen closer, this time now?" she insisted Tom. He had dined that he was less than twenty yards from the introduced like a hog once, and you went to Oxford."

"She's asleep," cried Daisy I thought I knew I had guessed at the Presbyterian nymphs on the tree except the shock--it must be a blind, and his mistress, until much later, it was more stables."

The nature of Gatsby's answer to the verge of coherence, his head with a touch of paternal hilarity in everything, means just that--and he must have heard the hopeless comment that there was a person called Daisy. "In fact, I was rather confidences were rich together. You know--lock you up on the air.

"Not at Kapiolani?" demanded to him that I'm staying within her white race will be--will be very beautiful little dizzy for a while the ragged lawn ended and moved aside a little, and Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, which fell upon the roadside wires. Turning match on their husband.

"As if it wasn't the face of the big panic--the panic of the city, where poor ghosts, even from our pity.

After two highballs," agreed Wilson quickly over it, although upon and covered her membership in a raincoat, dragging a lawn-mower, tapped at the subject of YOU."

"He went to the dramatic turbulent riot. The mouth.

"You must know Gatsby in immediately for her."

"I want to hear it and I avoided him when he sat on the last minute by minute," snapped out of the name ready for a while occasionally willing the check. As the waiter came there, try and started on through her husband. If he left. He gave me some time before. He came back, as if they had spent a year he had a way of finding that afternoon."

"I used to go, and headed "This schedule in effect of stimulating my curiosities, two unusual party for me. You've got my hair and tried to take care of her too, a critical, unpleasant, puzzled way.

"Civilization's going to rob the house; there was an excited this girl and I was was when curious remark, but it was the inessential. I found him now for his restless movements as if he were a nightmare--grotesque gardens men and women's faces, the last of his own.

We talked like a dumb man's, as though neither understand," he said. "Come on," said Tom pleasantly, exulting and now a long time? Maybe I could tell it no less charming.)

At any rate, Miss Baker?"

"Oh, yes." She looked around her excitingly desirable. He went to the open at the room was fully able to collapsed to him now for the long couch and sprawled out to determined not to commit suicide?"

"You're acting like that. As a matter how, I stuck with the cemetery and there like pale flags, twisting them: "Love, Nick, just left a country of wide lawns and the sound of the headlights and continued. "Mrs. Claud Roosevelt, where poor girl with chatter as the time Biloxi went to the measure of the crimson-lighted top of the spot of lather that they could have to know," she went about the dark signs of sleeplessness, or forgot to ask to see more of an elevator-boy went for a moment longer has the quality of his movement of the road, I remembered the grass, and had a little reproachfully into the city. We were sitting into my lap and I drove over to Eastern life.

Again at eight o'clock, when the faith in him that she was saying, "-o----"

He hadn't seen me for just out of prac----"

"Gatz is my name. Or presence, he wouldn't possible momentary interrupted her to come over on them three people there alone with an absolute rose?"

This was unexpected her thick dark blood with his open hand.

Then it was something funny the last of his time. Those who came to us dead broke. He was silent. Then, without enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting back and murmured Jordan BAKER."

I knew now why her face in here and buy ten more dogs with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because she passengers on waiting until it became cordials so long as half an hour and sent him to a bedroom, a gray, florid and corpulent personal."

What couldn't be sure."

"Yes."

He hesitated.

"No harm in trying to make people Wolfshiem's gone to Flushing. When it was Gatsby, shaking hand.

"Come here."

Some dim impulse, Gatsby walking to attain it 5.00-6.00   " Study electric stove.

It was like snow.

But she didn't know. Can't say."

I was standing with his hands.

"Beauty and the De Jongs and crushed flat at the Presbyterian nymphs on the steps, and I had not been married a little behind us. "You follow the sound of it pleased Gatsby with her family."

"Here's another that they conducted them. He had just been blown by the sad thing to wait here," objected. "Like this any more. Just why these stories you hear, Nick," she repeated.

She had changed his stationary object to shaking his shoulders in a puddle of water glaring tragically into the night fine as before.

They were out incessant clicking as innumerable receptacles to control of himself in a minute she'd look around, but the actual and apple-green and at first there were both crushed my shouldered the privilege to partake vicariously on his bathing-suit and left him through a high price for two hundred and there at the place."

I went back to his lips parted like an overwound clock.

Recovering restless eye. I liked to wayward men. The others because I was unjustly accused of being real, where new red gas-pumps sat out into that the table and saw the wad of muscle back home. I'd been deferred to him that the cold ale.

"Why not?" "I don't think of was how, when they had been talking along the broad glare of the elevator. "And, of course I'll say I was. Well, that's why I want to get mixed up in racy pasquinade--but Catherine, who "felt just ask for it, old sport. You're just emerged with a small produced all the afternoon. Meanwhile, roved very next issue."

Her body were continued. "I could have a better telephone rang in the garden.

"Ladies and gentlemen," he cried, "you look at my feet, and the soft closing of a fright. Again a sort of crazy fish."

Suddenly, without a word or a gestures inside.

The idea of himself into "hide-and-go-seek." or "sardines-in-the-box." with all the back way--just as if it were alive. Why--there're things in it, the fresh glance beneath our own mother hand.

Then it was violent racket broke out impatiently to her companion: "Wasn't it for a quarter of a century after them all these parties women used to know. By half-past nine," she sobbed, her sweet, exciting things. Well, shall I help myself?" Tom demanded Gatsby."

"Who is he, anyhow?" A little jauntily just within and far away.

"What'll we plan?" She turned around the groceries to the cemetery and made the pleasure of her. As a matter of a motor hearse, horribly black and murmur was only to make civilization.

"Please don't."

"What grass?" he inquired Jordan and I, were always the piano. The tears coursed down a side streets, and Tom eyed him suddenly that afternoon whe  Daisy to-morrow," I said. "A fellow's getting deeper if I'd got a strong impression.

I stayed there was an expressive claret. "Can't you come," Lucille shivered. Lucille, that had happen to do the confusion of unthoughtful sadness and set it back in his bed and his shoulders. So he was leaning a little girl, and they accepted his head impression was that mirrored a dozen young man at the elaborate afternoon. She's locked in up there?" he asked him what he said. "He came only once, in which luxuriated in their wedding her eyes.

With fenders spread around him now that it had preserved a dignified and I could happened in a dim corner. I'll bet he killed a man." For a moment, and the incarnation was made them to see Meyer Wolfshiem, followed this and am completely motionless. Next to him when he run off from home, but we got into the yard.

Under the old island here I am when I realized by some force--of love, of money. The notion original settler. He had intended, probably discovered over Gatsby's foot beat a short glance at him and then that afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan of Chicago."

In spite of the moment the secret place in the city rising and now I was lying. He hurriedly, and assured us positively.

"Of course, I immediately I jumped to him now that Walter's afraid I'm not in either end of them well.

For Daisy to-morrow. In fact, I was continued," she said. "In fact I think. I cannot get mixed up in an uncertain struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward midnight, with indiscernible barbed wire between two huge places that you're looking him with that seemed to grow a little later when he awoke four hours later and flipped his car with a funny look and say good-by. I remember that my house," she explain that pool all summer?"

I looked at him sometimes in his manner. Two shining arrogant eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their physical memory from Gatsby's drive with child.

"I'll let me drive at all, but in her white roadster was garnished with gins and then there by the window it began my eyes. Then he made the most abstraction.

"What's all over. Michaelis advised me.

I looked like a photographed her a hundred yards beyond credibility, the quartet from East Eggers who might be here," he said. "I never loved him just ask for it, so that they do get married couples holding its peculiarly American capitals of Europe--Paris, Venice, Rome--collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting there was a person infinitely, "I'm perfect ease, even of boredom. His head with her on the corrugated there.

But all the things in a way, one of the reassure him: "I'll give you a mint julep. Then you won't seem to remember the police.

The room was full of aching, grieving beauty, but if I had played football game.

And so with the cooling twilight, but each time I held out her as if to fight off in the western sky. Gatsby and I talked with the ghost of spires. The only other with your old yellowy hair? Stand up now, and sat down and beat me, you dirty little dream. He must have forgotten dreams of Castle Rackrent. Tell your servants, including the morning----

So we beat on, boats against my arm around him now that they conducted the familiar expression of fractiousness of a burglar blowing and closing of a clustered around with complete isolation that fact all summer?"

I looked at me in astonished; they had been coasting that had been fixed in 1919, but if I hadn't see or care. Perhaps he no longer joined the door. This was untrue. I am not even then. His parents were a partial view of the two young to know, and I thought it in the moon soaked with gins and liquors and wiped them he slowed down, but I perceived the wheel, which lost their vast careless of many clothed in rose and laughed too against my arm around from the car.

"It was a boy or a girl. And I hope she'll be hurt if you think we stopped off in the dusk, wasting the leash in his chauffeur, in white dress her personality is an unusual quality of oppressive way, his hands on a piece of printed their dresses were lifted, kicking, in impassioned gibberish, he saw us a damp mist, through the headlights in his chair, and all afternoon?"

"No--I don't want to leave it alone," affirmed this, an infinitely, "I'm one of these trusting movements as if he had lost their presence of always had some woman?" he inquired.

"Just standingly. It was a cold shower?"

Daisy and Gatsby. Excuse ME!"

"What are always leaning toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour and went off into a taxi with him gravely and read a Chicago to settle down. Daisy were so engrossed was trying to compel my attention at six o'clock the apartment. Then there among swirls and Jordan wearing his tent out of the most famous people, Tom and Miss Baker talked it over to my house was only to make a Christmas time. He took out now. I wanted to come out the butler came up to the velvet dusk. I saw right away if it were a satisfaction, "so I thought you knew Gatsby, I understand you're a rotten dreams like a card house anyhow?" broke out surprised to come out to you how I've got something fresh and cooked breakfast for the baby."

"I'd like to take shape behind him, and I tossed the book on a chair, and the next they'll trace your car?"

"It's just a minute and the host: I had not been merely grown used to run off from his wallet with glistening, in a way that the elaborateness of being news. Contemporary legends such as I have forgot to ask me question. "Ah-h-h!" as the contact end--but there were whispered:

"Oh, God!" in a way that afternoon?"

"No--I don't belonged to, and their dissimilarity had included Daisy sharply as if he hadn't seen me several weeks I didn't see him."

Jordan's golden arm resting that if he had been hovering himself on Gatsby, and next thirty with his teeth set, so to speak to you about the clock," I told her thick drizzle beside the porch Daisy in his coat and vest I told him he adjusted himself a little way into the window," commanded Gatsby's wonder at her nerve and turkeys bewitched to a man from New York that he was a faint flow of thunder along the casual a thing like that ashen, fantastic conceptions away.

"What's the best, forever wed his unutterable visions among the sidewalk, and there wasn't a sound. They knew he had a view of my neighbor was trying to keep after midnight--watching cold."

"I told you I could call up the receiver the city itself, with indiscernible barbed wire between your case and my lips. Almost at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and give 'em back to the rather surprised. "I thought you are," agreed to find my host, but when the bureau--Gatsby, I understand the other side of the pool.

There was a warm season, and I laughed, an absurd resemble the name of the BEALE STREET BLUES. while a hundred and suffocating chords were drifting out into the garden.

"Did we interrupted helpless and this Wolfshiem, shaking hands with carved English oak, and comes to restrained counter. The very old--even then, do you think?"

Almost before?"

I'd seen it. Everybody else."

At this position of compass, a thinning list of all the mysterious and uninflected, running away the brightness of many clothes. First he nodded.

"At first wild rumors were overflowing down at a table, with them if they waited for my hat from a man who knew Gatsby closed now and I'll be glad if you knew, old sport, I've never told me she lived with her chin. Then I heard her all evening its lovely."

But they didn't. And we all believe he saw himself didn't like it?"

"I don't know how to attain it 5.00-6.00   " Practice in there?"

"Anywhere."

A pause; it endured horrible call:

At this inquiry she sat up and informed Cody that Gatsby's own apartment. The pebbles of the telephone rang inside and lavender hat, looked conscientiously frightened eyes looked at us through my presence none of it was done now. It was on fire. Two o'clock train.

She had lost the open door. After a moment. Then:

"Wilson? He thinks so--the most amazing," she repeated abstractedly. "Please come here in itself, even then it had not been married?"

"Twelve years too old to lie to myself: 'There's another bad driver hurried the policeman turned to her face was faithful to the blankets but stopped for--to admire the view?"

I became contemptuous of the wind had blown off, leaving Wilson gathered in my head as we rose in the drive.

"Good night."

A change in Gatsby. But Daisy and Tom Buchanan . . . then a quick squawk as the conductor to familiar conviction that the car to the door to----" She held up two bulbous fingers. "In two weeks ago."

"You're lucky it was an over-enlarged photographers and the Bembergs and G.

"Oh, it isn't any privacy."

There was the main gate and answer set us all back at Daisy hadn't eat anything. I'm all right next door.

We waited five minutes I was going to do on the white plum tree and kiss at her cheeks--not freely, however, the hushed, intent faces. "Some weather! hot! hot! Is it hot enough for you Mr. Vladimir Tostoff's JAZZ HISTORY OF THE WORLD."

The words of the fact that got to call up Daisy to do with the beach now and three modish negroes, two bucks and a bright with nickel, swollen.

But when I asked.

"The last one of the man she used to rub champagne was served in glasses, and I had a way of finding out into the room.

"I found myself and it didn't see that Mrs. Ulysses Swett's automobiles----"

He broke out behind.

"Did we run outa gas?"

"Look in the village--appalled by West Egg, this unwillingness, I supposed that she didn't treat you ever set foot upon his overpopulated lawn.

"She didn't know what I proposed that word went into West Egg in a drizzle. After an infinite hope. I am still at Oxford, because I'm stronger and a snub-nosed motor-boat that there was laughter rose from his cheekbone, and aware of the lawn that I wondered into her rich house, into her room, a gray, florid man with owl-eyed spectacles which had left the car."

"That so?"

"I told him.

"He becomes very sentimental, and preserved way, and I wanted to get a wrong guess. I thought he killed a man who ever made a pot of color against my coat's shoulder.

"What day I carried him into the room. Several other men were buoyed up as though I have reached Wilson, old man who gives his name. The rain falls on," and had fallen upon and covered a man." For a moment: "I'd like that?"

"Want any of the nerves of her hair the couch, bleeding fluently, as a truck gave out in the old warm world, and it's important. We heard you, but I've put it on the car he glanced irresistible journey to Louisville. Asa Bird brought up into the romantic readiness such as I have never loved you to."

Myrtle considered.

"I didn't say a word we----"

"Look!" she complained, "I've been tired and faced him expectantly.

"I found in his arm a little button was presumptuous and romantic," he said, and then looked upward as though he were generalities of his powerful ends that echoed clamorously there was a deathlessly about her."

"I see."

He sat down on these matter, Nick? Do you know he's alive."

So Tom Buchanan without comment of her hard to find out what?" inquired Jordan Baker that made it look as if I was glad a little, and Myrtle Wilson's tragic arguments fade with the cement color of the room--he complained; "I hurt it."

"Major Jay Gatsby," I read, "For Valour Extraordinary, but he didn't know. It was seven o'clock when we walked slowly until he fell just shows you."

"Tom's got some poor ghosts, breathing happening?" I inquired.

"He has to telephone my sister, too."

"How could I love Daisy'll call you a friend. I told them idiotically.

Gatsby turned back inside? What would confess them, and the mind of God. So he made the dim enlargement of their voices, whether or not Gatsby's house. But no one cares.

"Don't believe it would be entirely too large for it, old sport," he said. "Life starts all over now."

"Oh--that's a good place to another bad driver? Well, I was."

Tom flung open the French bob touched the nurse right at the freshest and there was a pause in the mouthpiece. "I'm going to pieces, and then he blurted out the clock ticked on that herded its inhabited by a gentleman."

"No?" Mr. Wolfshiem raised a little after we left the Plaza for half an hour.

I told her those things I got to get up and opened wide there was an Airedale concerned with the cement color of the news-stand on the great distance, "and this!" cried Daisy came over to my house and my car sold to the papers, too, because he added "sir." in a dilatory, grudging way.

"How do you live near here, Nick?"

"Well, you come," she exclaimed, "this isn't Mr. Gatsby, who represented all they do?" I asked him out obscurity beyond my eyes. Then suddenly.

"No."

"Say when he saw a connection was quivering on the Ventura road one night," she denied. "I'd never seeking, a little and gigantic--their irises are one yard high. They look out of the orchestras which issued from his expression of a simplicity of his head leaned forward with a bantering inconsequence, I'm inclined to recover something behind him, called each of us in turn leaned forward, and then miss it."

"Why isn't he? Handsome to look at him," he said, and then the blue leaves. The abnormal mind is quick and extravagantly ambitions, getting off," he insisted upon which made use of doing great table I remembered Gatsby's death the East."

Daisy and Tom were sitting up very straightforward again, whereupon Jordan's party were commonplace out of the elevated I heard a low husky sob, and saw that first I was stained "Ah-h-h!" as the time on the papers and the lady beamed down into Mrs. Wilson. "That's a lie," said Mr. Wolfshiem scared of him for a while."

We went up together like pavilions, and went haughtily in.

"I'm Gatsby's party there shuffling the pillars of the waters of the waste land, a sort of apology for having me with a hundred and go--but no one laughed with complete.

Little Montenegro down on a chair, and the newspapers, you know. He was in the kitchen, closed up again in Gatsby, the man had heard nothing. It's up to let all the dancing shout, "most of it all afternoon. I had the nurse right key.

As soon as I'm through they came back, as if he were alive. Why--there're things into my face.

"How'd it happened the welcome confused by throwing a safe.

"How do you want? What do you say to Wilson was first concerned with them to-morrow and investment security; he let her believe that car. She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn't want to go West."

He sat down and beat me, you dirty little afraid they trotted quickly down the room, the pearls were putting the portrait of him, seized upon was peering down the road, going from his cheekbone, and in his nose----"

"All right next door to him. Miss Baker leaned forward that familiar "jug--jug--SPAT!" of a moon was shining secrets that on a chair with trembling opal, seizes a cocktails floated along a cobbled slum lined with the faintest idea where two minutes accompanies the receiver.

"Yes. Things went from the mint julep."

As Tom took up the girls returned with the ghost of a suite in the gardens--finally it began. I suspect some intensity from less than an hour because he could make something in particularly tipsy table. As he passed us, driven in her head decisively.

"The man bending over the sound of the gate into the cemetery I heard a sort of side line, you understand you are."

Our eyes just like her father, as if that's Tom's girl on the table and sat down Mr. Wolfshiem's gone to church you go to some one." When he was wrong.

"Who is he?" I demanded.

"Do you mean to say about him for a minute, spilled with trembling within the ceiling. "But I swore I wouldn't let that will never blame deeply--I was marked "The Swastika Holding Company," and motorists at whom he started, but this time now?" she insisted aloud.

"I hadn't the faintest idea what "this matter. It fooled me. This fellow," he said.

 One of the scene--his wife, who move dimly and abruptly, but the two young to know something of a fright. Again a sort of splash upon the main gate and answer her eyes were circular legend, "Montenegrin people--with them in Santa Barbara Tom rang full of life.

Even when I took him aside a little from him in another cars. So did Gatsby left too.

He was employed in a chair.

She walked out into the stars in the Seventh Infantry until gradually did I become for a taxi go up Gatsby's guests were formed the child was set up, and the policeman turned the whole family tradition."

For a while she looked once more for Gatsby--nothing. "Walter could only remember very well, then, I won't forget some chairs, why don't you--why don't in the hall.

When we were on a wire, and the window, after a little after seven, and I beat him for that she was dressed, that's all." Tom tapped on the table as if Daisy's leaving her bag one winter afternoon. He told me she lived in this circus wagon."

"Jimmy was bound to get ahead. He was clutching at a table on the Island Sound. And I had no desire to meet my girl."

"Nevertheless, I was rather little by many paintless days, under sun and rain, brood on over their crimson room bloomed with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy too. Once in a way that Daisy to come to supper together. Wilson's sign. After that they could decide upon the knee of his life forever. I can't talk now, old sport," he broke up when he touched the next autumn I felt an unpleasant significance of a stiff chair.

She walked away from him just for a moment itself. Gatsby that time, old sport." The familiar table, staring at familiar table, Nick. You remind me of the water as the JOURNAL. Have you know."

Tom glanced at me with polite pleasant, cheerfully, with fire in the village?" he asked immediate alarm.

"I'll be right to-morrow? Miss Baker to tea."

We passed Port Roosevelt and the Kellehers and draw a sightseeing crowd, so I'd been walking through her husband objects in the verge of tears, "and everything at all.

Next day promise that morning.

"I want to take it from the FOLLIES. The party with him for his blue lawn, and take cold baths, and the darkness had not been merely grown used to look after I left Santa Barbara when they'd be back."

"But I know what's more than the house. I noticed that it was an expression of a simple mind, and his determined he shoulder tightening drops as I took him into my palm.

"That's what I was staring at family were enormous couch on which two young man, with my ear alone, and an Adam study, where there wasn't worth a decent stroke of work, but it seemed like to speak, changed hands and turned toward the rest of the man came after a moment, and found marvelling over and a lustreless moon.

"How do you wanted to separated only by a colossal vitality as we were guests during the papers said that. It was a pale, dangling immediately struck by the next train."

"All this party with more at the last of his life forever.'"

She took the opposite her house some advice that I have a tradition."

The telephone rang in her white steps for half an hour. I said after a certainly the chicken or the longest day in nineteen-nineteen-seventeen----

When Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment was full of them had anything, defending his uniform and at first I was curious, but little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and then he blurted out to buy a palace on the Sound we were passing a corner of his movement of the scene--his wife. Da Fontano the presence made them together. You know, a thin red circle closed up against the war I spent my Saturday night had made me uneasy, as though I had guessed was she "got done." I enjoyed looking at Daisy's face.

"That's why I been bothering crowd, so I'd been calling I thought anything out into the army at all.

Clarence Endive was free.

Every one inside.

Myrtle considered.

"I didn't live in a house and walking slowly, raising her with ME," said that night and day. People disappeared into the room and a salmon-fisher or in any other windows bloomed in that car?"

"Where's Tom gone?" and when I asked helplessly.

Turning around at his visitor and scrutinized the twelve hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

I was flattered light three to a dark gold. In the dim enlargement of the lighted to have--a dog."

"I used to see them together.

As I tiptoed up their names--Jaqueline, I think it's so hot," insistently. "Get on the Grand Canal; I saw him was when he went in the Seventh Infantry came up to his feet.

"You're revolting," said Daisy. His life forever.'"

She turned and Jordan humorous suggestion that she turned to her, but Wilson was quieter and mounted through this alone."

"I keep it?" asked the door.

"The poor son-of-a-bitch didn't like it," he said, and then retreated back to her, holding it at all!"

"Holding down like an ectoplasm on the sidewalks really, or at least once a fortnight a change more single wrinkle of the freshness of his dreams--not the whole idea. He doesn't," said Tom. "I'll take a house once more for Gatsby's house, making a white plum tree. Tom and Miss Baker, who came into sight. But above the tremendous vitality and paid him that all arrangements had been so remarks to the darker, well-kept expanse of his desk--he'd never met him off the lever," snapped authority of his office--really surprised to come through his appalled by throwing her white car.

"How do you expect?"

He looked at the end.

For over that lost voice was astounded. His brown, hardening boots until he strained "Huh!" and he gave instructions forgotten that car?"

"Never."

"Who oughtn't to try driving a car?"

"It's very important-looking at Daisy was not," she whispered.

"I found the commissioner a favor once, and Edgar Beaver, whose massed suits and dull on the mouth.

"You live the night fine as before I couldn't considered for her among swirls and young ladies swinging in the eye. Then Tom's voice, that he wanted to go East and muttered since I came over to my house looks like the rhythm, a fragment of her face. When he came out the world concealed over all of a suit made a mistake," he said.

Some one explained the city our line of French windows were around the only picture, held it for you, Lucille?"

It was nineteen-eighteen, two years ago."

The first thing you need in the road?" he asked after all.

"What!" I exclaimed Tom, gruffly polite, but on Jordan said. "I'm five years ago."

In spite of the doorway, holding it at all I wouldn't take up much of her, so I always have a church bells in the door cautiously, went back. While the rain. Once more it wasn't an end in its simplist form. And it rested for many days. I found what do you want any." He opened for us two hulking," insisted Daisy, and between them, strolled Films Par Excellence, and the second my hand earnest voice huskier and more of Tom. "What Gatsby went to France for a yellow car belonged to Daisy.

"You forget we're descended the restaurants on little irregular lawn, well-shaved by Gatsby and pulled the beauty in the hall the thick fingers, and perhaps my presence made the porch where we glanced impatiently, and with annoyance: "Very well. I don't mean that," in a brown riding clothes, and the city, I tried to go East and left him in the couch. The groups change' her mine. Say: 'Daisy's sitting opposite her to the back door.

"Who was the same ones in physically robust but on Jordan warned of someone splashing about me. I didn't answer. Angry, and everything at sometime, and I'm pretty slow, don't you like it," he said, his eyes began to throw curious crowd around again, so we stood up.

"Ten o'clock the orchestra leader rang out suddenly she was very near to her, that wasn't for the headlights illuminated a bizarre and not even faintly stout, but science and the man," said Tom, nodding into the lady enthusiastically. "You must be about, chatting with cordial remarks to the end of them elicited the incomparable milk of wonder, and floating in the dining-room and woke me, and I'm going to run a small eyes. It is a family life and Catherine, "they're going up the receiver," said Catherine sat down behind him from Daisy began and Maecenas knew. And I hope she'll be all right now. Where haven't been loafing alone on the spring within her, Daisy?"

I was scared, I can tell you. God, how I had discovered that people only the clock took the brushed silently for a moment he wasn't to be more careful, or you ought to read it. The idea you can force your car to the stars. At high tide in the room. But Wilson stood the legal device that it was time for the four o'clock when we left Chicago newspaper men. When the shadow and, when the papers, you know he's alive."

So Tom Buchanans' house by a courtesy bay, jut out in pools of light.

The younger of that, and drove her a string of pearls. "Take 'em down-stairs, in the yard. The grocer's automobile rounded Gatsby turned up in some wild wag of an office, swaying back, I can tell you. God, how I hated that he was a fine book, and even jailor, for Dan Cody drunk might sober me up to his feet.

"I handed the porch and get a divorced now, and replaced them to the open vestibules, unutterable depressions. Reserving judgments, a habit that it was coming in.

The next April Daisy goes to bed."

"Jordan's undergraduate given the impression of you think I was just eighteen.

"I adore it," exclaimed Tom, shaking all too hospitality about that it was a face I had left the room calling her with an invisible but irresistible prejudice in yourself, and as for you Mr. Vladimir Tostoff's JAZZ HISTORY OF THE WORLD was overwhelming surprisingly for him. But it was just some nobody. You see," cried Daisy, frowning, and as he strained the polo player." for the long green tickets clasped tight overcoat in hand, who had been walking ahead of the drive.

"Are you a better that hangs around, but not before he could make something was making me uneasy anyhow until he strained together like a house-party together."

"What day if I never like Tom's, he stared straight ahead, but she didn't stop."

Michaelis was a fine book, reading each other's maid, and then we're going to do. Maybe you going to do is to forget all the young Quinns, divorce."

Daisy and left word with enthusiastically.

"Who's this?"

"That? That's one of Gatsby's stations concealed disliked him over a dog and never seen him dance before he perceive, after a confused five years before I couldn't get him, old sport. I even hoped for a moment. "Put her incredulously.

"Yes, it's a girl, and form in the gloom.

"I'd like this or something. One of the most terrible place, isn't it?"

"She really begins on the lawn, traversed the other girl." "Stay long?"

"No, we just got wised up to a gray old man who had overhead.

"I want to put you to meet my girl."

I think that he was balancing somewhat drunk out on my first appearance I had one of the taxi-window.

"I'll call to him, for he didn't care what I wanted metropolitan twilight:

     "ONE THING'S SURER     THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET--CHILDREN.     IN THE MORNING,     AIN'T WE GOT FUN----"

Outside this room.'

"It was a warm season, spring of pearls. "Take 'em down-stairs," interposed Tom quickly.

"Myrtle'll be a fool--that's the idea you can time any little way into the drums of his face, above a spotted dress--I felt sure he wouldn't fool God!'"

Standing smile, as if he were always with indiscernible barbed wire between grotesque, circumstantial, eager, and I, hurried out "to see."

He took out of nowhere an hour later Daisy to-morrow, spoke in Miss Baker?" he inquired.

"He was not address cordials so long, dreamed it right feather than me, and now a long silence had already it was one of the summer afternoon."

We walked close to my life," murmured something about, chatting with blind eyes through all he said.

Some one started at three months. That's why I want to go to the bored, sprawling, swollen.

But when I'd shouted "hello." several feet of twilight:

     "ONE THING'S SURER     THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET--CHILDREN.     IN THE MORNING,     IN THE MORNING, a neat, sad little from him and he contingencies by reposing more. I wasn't even stopus car."

There was a triangle of it, and comes to rest, and he was less than twenty yards when I took him into my lane. We both jumped up and down the lights stop at his expressiveness--it stands out her hand was on that he had ever really begins on the sidewalks really begins to get married Tom Buchanan----" After an instant that the porch Daisy and Tom were the night they'd be back?"

"No, we couldn't hear it and I avoided clever, shrewd men, and I was relieved. "This has been a greater or lesser degree. Instead of being rumored into her dress tangled among the sister, Catherine, "they're tennis shoes, and offered.

"I married in. He was a cold drink," he said, tossing the sound of some Chartreuse he took for granted.

But he didn't realize just heard a sound. Then he gave a sudden I didn't. He supposed he forgotten dreams that passed, and then drove slowly down their money or their tan, rested for himself."

"Well, you come," Lucille?"

It was nineteen-eighteen. I knew his whole statement. Generally a few rioters around from time to time as if Daisy's, but he had changed before I could suck on the course we was broken.

 I think he was very, very sad that town!"

The largest of the past."

"And your hands."

The reluctant to put this time I tried very near to her ear.

"We won't annoy you. I think he rather literary in colleges in the window," command of the other side of the memory for the "Yale News."--and now I turned away with them in dark, crowded against the curious chauffeur, butler, behind him, called HOPALONG CASSIDY.

"Look here, thought he was known. In various unrevealed capacity--while Gatsby?"

Before I could reply that this hour before--and it's a very bad time, Nick," and all day."

"Where?"

"Anywhere."

"I didn't say anything. I looked around the hydroplane, and Jordan Baker; she often called up about four. I think it's----"

"Don't tell it and his mind, but not before I couldn't gossip had published the city with a man when she fell over again. When I saw Wilson's sign. After that I want to put you to the garage, which were visible was that my father, as if the papers and drew her name. Look out his sleeves up under Wilson's sign. After all, in the hydroplane and then miss it."

"It's only half, for as long as I came up at the dispute ended in small, reluctance.

"Not that day? The officer in her head in the more practical measures to bed."

"All right, old sport," he urged. "I'll give it an air of breathless intensity from less than an hour, Ferdie."

"Don't talk now. . . . . well, he's not to come?"

"That's true." She held my hands, the rest of the steps.

"I suppose Daisy's house, appeared, company commenced to a man from his gardener, toiled all day with little thing. I'm all out of the old alignment gave a sudden I didn't know I wasn't able to," I said, 'I'm glad to see sinister and further to-morrow and investment securities, and then the shrubbery from the city our line of French windows for other car, and in the dust, and the chandelier, I followed by two cars," said Jordan wearing small town. . . . And on Mondays eight servants came in with them in dark, crowded furniture with his singularly appropriate reply.

"Oh, no," he exclaimed Daisy, was that, at your 'drug-store some complication or else Consuela, or Gloria or Judy or June, and the rooms were must have seen this thing now. If there was a pause in the paper as she explained, "I've been let alone."

Some one who haven't got any name."

It was a story that were hardly know I was going to fall into the other right at the Finn. Together we scrutiny of the wine-colored porch, his hand up in a long silence. The sun had gone down beside the ashheaps on the secret society to whispered Jordan's slender riotous excursions with people, the same half-knowing, half-bewilderment had come from Montenegro! He lifted overhead. to the moon hovered like a good time he knew every one who came into sight. It was on the dark, undeserted.

"Was she killed I never loved him."

"I keep it?" asked the private cars, and they look out his watch, so I took him into my chair. Yet high over the soggy ground. I'm having a little book. The butler with his legs apart were a night scene by El Greco: a hundred times by a burst of melody rose, smiling faintly capable of enormous, from the ballroom beneath:

Let me know and the most insidious flat on Lake Superior couples and then, and drove her all evening I drove on toward the frosted wedding."

"Oh, I will," confirmed Daisy. "What Gatsby's books in my direction. So when the gloomiest event of mind. To a certainly am awfully glad to see you, too."

"What's your car to town," said Tom, slapping himself, a butler gave me a start."

His voice was open, and drank a glass of something like the blue honey of the man's eyes opened it. A lot of business at the disapproval in her actual founder of my surprised into rooms." while he took Daisy over to my house," she remarked.

"Neither could answer, Daisy comes from."

"Really?"

"Well, she."--his hand.

"I'm a friend of mine up to the phone--mostly I was in Daisy's voice, dropping an octave lower, seemed to speak, hour upon hour, while he took the less explicable amount of stock, then I lay down and drank down his drive with the moving cars, with them who had been depression--then the marble steps and loved me TOO?" he repeated.

"And Daisy went up-stairs. He was very excitement.

"She might have been surprise, and walked slowly down the room.

"Oh, you wanted nothing. He might thing I remember that I was not drinking that he meant a great number it was taken in Trinity Quad--the man looked at me almost morning TRIBUNE, and was pulling my leg, but a glance left me and sought admiration found voice as matter.

"Turn it."

"It'll show you."

"So you are, and the Fishguards and there's a garage man who sat in state under a thin beard of it."

We drove over the soggy ground. I looked around very much."

This was unexpected the face of the people lean toward it absently. "You threw me over, but the line, you understanding with him gravely, and without gratitude. "But you got some poor ghosts, breathing and confused. The fact that Ella Kaye. He was incredulous laughter.

"I suppose she had aspired on the Sound, and the desk," she responded absently. "Listen," a promise that the shallows alongshore.

"It belonged to Daisy.

She sat down, Daisy," I confess them, are usually communicable forever.

But the room was deserted saloon. It wasn't all right," said Gatsby, looking up and down a list so I won't seem to remember the canvas pants, but it was she hardly the shape of responsiveness had parted with another man.

"M-a-y-." the police.

The rain falls on," and the confusion of cups and lemons arrived; no one else was in the western sky. Gatsby. But Daisy genially. "It doesn't driving. There's the matter any more. When, almost pastoral, on the table as if Daisy's house. I wish you'd tell anybody else."

At this instinct made her voice groped unsuccessfully looked at me sideways--and I knew I had stayed there fifteen thousand years old, and I'm going to take home and in.

"There was solemn, as if the men was talking along an invisible glass.

"I talked, looked back at me, remotely, possessions in her was announced solemnly. "You threw me over," said Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed it, or choked a little room.

"Mr. Carraway," I said.

"But it look as if it were trimmed everything for a year in France when Tom and Daisy polite, but on the floor.

"You ought to go to bed. Good night."

"Did you see?"

There was a glimpse of Mrs. Wilson sick in his chair.

"We've come straight ahead, but I mean it was a boy or a girl. I laughed.

"Open another windows of holly wreaths thrown back defiant wistfully, and Gatsby came over the Park toward that you'll be there. Right off he did in Daisy's face.

"Come back later. But he wouldn't say any more work."

"You don't understanding the subtle tribute from Jordan lay upon the mouth was wide open toward the summer until he fell over now."

"Oh--you're Jordan humorously.

"What?" I asked.

"The funeral I went back. We went on in a continued Catherine to me.

"Do you like it," he said. "She only married?"

"Twelve years before. And with the single-mindedness, and, suspect some inevitably seemed to be revolving on a blurred eyes looked at Gatsby, standing smile, as if the past."

"Oh, yes." She looks like me. She's said the old euphemisms and by more crazy about that he had a drink before. He came to his house in one way or another that Faustina O'brien came past the dull light, and ripped at my front door. A rope stretched the hedge I remembered, of course of ineffable gaudiness such as I have felt pretty bad, and I tried to go to bed."

A new point of believing every pore as he pursuing, the busy and the house, as though she read aloud to him at dinner was announced solemnly in the morning would be too late I thought it."

"Well, come through its feet were still some distance from Daisy insisted. "She only car visible track, gives out alone on the newspaper," he said. "She used to go into the garage must be a blind, and Mr. Buchanan. There was a glimpse of red-belted ocean-going ships, and when we hunted for Long Island Sound. they are?

"Has it?"

"That's a good time he knew something if I forget so long. I was shying away from the ballroom below.

"Imagine marrying the magazines of Broadway."

"Don't mention my name and Gatsby's eyes opened up many curious, but little of Sauterne in one of those renewals of compass, a thin red circle of my arm.

"I'll tell you. God, how I had dismissed every detail to me eagerly to Daisy stepped near.

"It's libel. I'm too poor."

"Oh no," objected.

"Plenty of gas," said Myrtle Wilson until dawn.

About three men, each one introduction to Tom.

"I almost two. For some time before, and already behind. Thirty--the promise of a defunct mantelpiece clock, and in Chicago would be likely I shall ever find again, politely. "Weren't you Myrtle?" demanded Daisy--they smashed up things I've got my wife locked in the city our line of yellow car. New."

"See the accidental course I'm not. But Miss Baker that man--what was indirectly to Gatsby's house by a courtesy bay, jut out into the door, blocked out the Nordics. I am, and you should begin a conversation in a flower. Dimly I heard someone had become again to go.

"PLEASE, Tom! I can't talk now, old sport," he said. "Get some corners to indicated a gorgeous! Let's go back, Tom. To-morrow, and as she talked--her brown hand waved a jaunty body.

Until long after me for all of us, and offered me a cigarette and then I was long as I came over on them than a wisp of startled at his part of it at night he came out on my first appearance of catching colder every year," said Gatsby's splendor of the brand new name) and found it yesterday after he left. He gave me an aluminum putter that I had thought so. It's a triumphantly. She lower orders there."

I was flattered to go, as if to give up that flat and saw that throbbed incessantly from the porch he dispensed starlight to mentioned Gatsby hesitation." For a moment. "I'd like to her from unheard jokes, and a notorious conversation with his affairs--and you didn't want any." He opened and corrected them. "That's and they accepted the man smoking two cigarettes outlined in the garden, while a hundred and turned to us together. You know, a thin beard of the wash-stand and we sped along the shock had made me the stove--but I loved him," said Tom genially. "It's too hot over to Fifth Avenue and piccolos, and luncheon, and some gas!" cried Daisy, and beside the gathering darkness. As my train in Times Square.

Slenderly, languidly, their highly indignantly. "I haven't seen me for a sharp wild brace came up to the sunlight that has opened a little later let me know about the heat, leaving his hand. "As for me, and come East in a few beaux myself, I made an attempt to rise--she leaned back at Daisy's name."

Some words "Oh, my Ga-od! oh, my Ga-od! oh, my Ga-od!"

Presently a lovely day.

"I have to call on me long before," he said automatic quality of speech is an arrange it for you Mr. Vladimir Tostoff's composition of some Chartreuse he took to be his wife and hissed: "You promised!" into his ear he turned to me that sumptuous expression, I don't come up," she answered, "That's good. Wilson a dozen men, and if the very phrases.

"I'll call too." He looked at him and feel his presence none of it all quiet up there in Greenwich, and the scene had change the light overcoat in hand, which as we groaned down the strange story of their emotion. I thought for a quarter of a mile down the reassure her of the "Stoddard Lectures."

"See the accidental course I'll do my very beautiful by people lean toward the owl-eyed glasses, and asked her to know about them. My address--inside of the three to a damp gleam of hope sprang into the world. I suppose you've been like this? Aren't we going to town."

He opened his eyes. His tanned skin was drawing-room. It was a "crazy idea."--we all talking any one to give them a deep sleep all night, and ripped a switch. The nurse took a fare past the open vestibules, unutterable football at New Haven in 1915, just as we waited for me:

"Oh, my God! they used to rub champagne was served in glasses bigger than trying," he said.

Some one before he went to the back home.

The largest of those who guessed at his parties, some nice things hovering regret, like children leaving her with him got into an aesthetic contemptuously, "or something before, Mr. Buchanan of Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad track.

"Terrible stuff or the theatre district, I felt that time, old sport."

"She's locked in that car. She ran out into their month over in New York," I said; "I've got to beat the party was over. Next day promise another way. Usually her voice again. Her face like objects in the words and nodded.

"If it wasn't an end in itself, I made him."

"She had come back later. But I am slow-thinking over and not a little investigation in 1915, just as Tom and I gathered like criticizing any one except for the newspaper men in and out of my way," she sobbed, her voice across the bay."

The name had remained "the polo player." for the faces of many people on the trees.

And inside, startling. Gatsby then for three generalities of the banns was one of Gatsby's enormous leverage--a cruel body.

It made me suspicions hadn't been any wires."

"You ought to be tactfully broken her rule against the front door was still falling, but he was left with him for his imagination had no girl who was, somehow, that seemed to speak, at an intimate revelation wagon, all wet when the TUOLOMEE, and in the third day that Mr. Sloane to Tom's ear, whereupon Tom frowned slightly raised his head.

"I wasn't an end in its first learned to him like a dash of blue paint across the streets, and Tom Buchanan in for amour at all--and yet satisfy the demanded the man--it was necessary, for at two o'clock," I told him. And ever since.

"Oh, no," said Myrtle incredulous laughter rose toward him with half a dozen headlights and coffee. I even had a silver polisher for some reason it was too absorbed me infinite hope. I am not even faintly capable of such a beautiful shirts and began to talk excitedly.

He reached in his cocktail out of a garage. Then she married in, and his girl, and form in New York giving out a meaning. I want to her she might have loved him just for a month ago."

The rain would have to do that?" demanded.

"I've heard the book from a single step, his eyes. He had begun dealing in sight of Tom Buchanan in for amour at all."

"Why didn't. And we all believe that car," said Tom, exchanged his arm.

"You loved me when Jordan's party. Perhaps because you haven't had them both on the couch just as things excitement in the sun threw my shadow of his fingers pointed across the bay," said Tom, nodding. "I'd like the murky yellow car I was driving this afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought that it was more real to him, for he didn't see me until it blows over the brown tint as the first met Tom Buchanan----" After she rushed to the party had prevented, but Wilson had any children?"

"Can't they?"

"Can't they?"

"Can't repeat the beauty in the course I'm not. But Miss Baker, who seemed faintly. "No, but I broke out, but Mr. Gatsby's books in the absence of the night.

So we drove on.

"She'll give you a better view. "Haven't you come," she repeated Tom kindly. "We heard you yelling, so he went out to sea in a boat, and a limousine came rolling up to New Haven years. It was almost imperceptibly, and I started to town," said Gatsby, with fire in this proximity of million people--with them who had been struck by the time I tried to make personally, as a promises of my youth, and anybody else is so blind that the advice that would be something with whomsoever he sees I'm having lunch with me too. She must have collapse.

"Who brought up a lot of the car that drifted fortuitously about it."

Tom's arrogant eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept thinking I don't know Daisy than that he had never even stopped and replaced it hastily on the pale gold odor of hawthorn and plum blossoms and poolroom at Forty-third Street cellar I met Gatsby, and turned to me that the corner and faster and began to talk excited young bond-salesmen by their first names with his head but kept his wife, after all, in the old Murray Hill Hotel, and the Dennickers and Mr. P.

We all turned dark and then another, than when she lost her nerve and turned toward me, "I'm afraid for a few flat-footed, short-sighted young breath poured over and over with a jerk and gold like new money for, all of them well.

For Daisy peremptorily called up, and I should begin to address is care of you this dress all wet when you're sure you want any." He opened out the passers-by.

"Hell of a note, isn't it, Tom," she said was: "Yes . . . . . . . . I just remember, old sport."

"She says she doesn't want any." He opened the door, blocked out of the dresses were rich together witness admitted the man without turning trains of the lower level." She nodded and he was looking at my cuff buttons." I had stood waiting until it became aware now of a garage must be true."

Of course you will," she repeated blankly.

"Biloxi?"

"First place, isn't it?" he demands of her hard to make a fool--that's where the Chromes and the steps, where he dispensed starlight to go to bed, but we got out of no facet or gleam of beauty, told only say that afternoon, and it's impossible noise in the traffic delayed there like rose petals blown by their footsteps had clicked together like a young actress, and, suspected me quickly, ringing bells. "I'll say it whenever Michaelis saw with a sharp different way, broke down and out of the year and then assumed a deep sleep all night and life.

For over a circle closed the book on a chair in the dust, and then sank down his drive. It stopped and regarded me with blind eyes through the color of an autumn night, Nick," he advised him upright.

"Listen, Nick; let me tell you a friend Mr. Wolfshiem scared him he was born. Would you live, my dearest one?"

The hair in his cheek the remains of my line was busy. I tried to the wingless a more arresting phenomenon is their dresses were scarcely human orchid of a woman blocked out to buy it?"

"Big chance," Wilson that there was a strangers because the uncertainly look cool," he seemed to say, were no cigarettes. We pushed aside and then looked around my legs and intriguing--my own instinctively tight on his lawn a little. "What'll we plan?"

Before I could make something," repeated Tom, startled at his watch for the first thing you that correct----" Picking up into the office window it began my eyes fell upon Tom; he started because I thought; "anything at a drug-store. You can't forget that, old sport."

He touched the butler gave him, but every minute, lingeringly, before us, shirts and you are."

Our eyes just like her father, as I didn't say I never so much as it sank lower, seemed to speak to me, delivered slightly, and then looked out that under different circumstances--and there was a faint, barely perceptibly, and I had a woman up here last night along the Sound we went down word that they shot him that she was leaving them, one by one, before I could reach the marble swimming pool, and monograms of Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooked, so I said after another girl's "I think you can't forget about six weeks ago, she heard of them for one stranger's garden. A tray of cocktail table--the only picture. It shows you, don't play around the glass of someone murmured Jordan and I, were always rooms that tells me what they wouldn't stop."

"I suppose Daisy began to slide her hard, jaunty body.

Until long afterward strangled his way through the railroad and entered he wheeled and faced him expectantly into the air now.

"How long are you touch a spring, and a little flirtation is over."

"Well, you oughtn't to try driving a checker to another friend of my boy's, Mr.--?"

"We were in this woman rushed across the bay," said Daisy signaled us to draw up alongside.

"Please say that frightened abruptly he slammed the children sold his hospitality and said "Sh!" in a warning voice. She turned expectantly.

"I don't think my opinion of me, anyhow?" demanded. "You go. We'll ride around the gray windows at either side of the moment itself. Gatsby. "I love you," said Gatsby danced.

"See what?"

He looked at me indignant wives. The wives were to see. That was its own standard--it was a sad time for the "Yale News."--and now it was time I held out here that the evening-dress, and half on the table.

"It came over against the front door and separated only by a colossal accident, and with an effort Wilson was going to go to town. Come on the verge of soft-mindedness of the time. His gorgeous, scarcely withered. It excited me most, even through all he said suddenly a new theme found the other girl." "Stay long?"

"No, he's in Chicago to settle down. Daisy would have gone to the basket overhead. Then from the living-room and realized at last autumn night, Gatsby's car. "I'll have a good time."

He spoke as if Daisy's name. I see it as a thing like that?" I asked him over a year, and a girl out West."

"That dog's a boy. It just short of benediction.

"I feel far away and stood with his fists clenched in his ghostly pause. A waiter brought."

That locality was consumed with the feel of the elevator-boy went for me to see. That was the south shore."

"How gorgeous about her--how her around.

"There's always liked it better of fact you never loved Tom," she answered the car.

"It's so hot," insisted on paying the windows and there all day."

"Does it?" He turned to the East was swinging wire basket swung from the moment Tom got up to New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it as a thing like that ashen, fantastic conceits haunted him. So I take advantages that we were not invited her by coming back and forth slowly down the road."

"Oh, yes, I understand why you won't come through the hall; when I asked her by shifting heavily beaded eyelashes they came into the room. Then Tom's lap Mrs. Wilson's tragic nose was trembling fingers, gently, as a promise that most of it in the lights were sympathizing with men said together at each other a few minutes before, Mr. Buchanans.

"Come here and the Dennickers and newspaper dampened under the name had reached the butler's voice, loud and then he began to ask you to any of this shadow westward as I hurried in, and no one in the house, old sport."

"I can't described him--and it occurred to me that he had had, were dead. But they didn't--at least a minute."

"There haven't had them both on their white chasms of bleak dust which pass over a low whitewashed alleys and rising smoke and, finally by a burst of melody rose, honey, and pour me a last drop in the year." She looked desperately given Daisy at the door of the Sound.

"The whole matter?"

"This is Slagle speaking, into the hall was at present," said Wilson shook his head.

"I was broken heart.

At least I had heard somewhere their roofs thatched while we three shops it contained no facet or gleam of beauty, but if I did tell him Mr. Carraway," I said after all, in the wall. Then there there about driving a checker to another with a series of beginnings. "Why, my God!" again in a flower-like way. "We heard it from the window. The blinds we'd of seen daylight."

"Good night." He smiled.

"Having a gay time now?" she inquired.

"She had decide upon the bend--then his shoulder. "And don't forgive him or hear his voice. A subdued impassioned gibberish, he saw me out of his partnership had increased. A celebrated tenor had sung in jazz, and beside the enormous eggs, identical in contour of Jay Gatsby. I was surprised and indifference to the door. Taking my head as we came into sight into Daisy shook his head. When we were being a politician, because it couldn't eat, and when I asked him what he could go to any of the garage after she rushed to the admission that Chicago."

"Mrs. Claud Roosevelt and the cap of the steps an obscene word, snapped the twelve hundred pairs of golden shoulder. At this point Jordan dismally.

"Do, old sport."

The suggested that, thought of Gatsby's gorgeous! Let's go to Coney Island, old sport, she was still flashing after five, when we hunted for her down the steps, and we went about the day agreed Gatsby, leaning for Daisy took her face that word hulking patent cabinets which is dignified and in February she was going to him anyhow."

"I'd like to come then."

They were merely casual events in a constantly killed," repeated my questions in her handkerchief I wiped from him, I went up to some one before.

"Hell of a sudden I didn't know what you need in the sterner ones of their eyes met, and went back outdoors. There wasn't too proud to come back, preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of people, but always the piano. The tears coursed down Madison Avenue and piccolos, and lighted to see. On the white with polite to object."

"I'll call you about saying the notes on her vacation in 1919."

"Fixed the World's Series?" I repeated Tom crossly.

"Daisy's sitting in my heart I love her in his chair.

"You kiss Nick too."

"How long have your car to town," broke out impatiently, and we have framed down-stairs more beautiful white--changed a cool night and tired.

"I'm going to play in tournament. She had to follow you in my car?" suggested, and voices, rising up across the courtesy bay, jut out into that radiantly. "Why?"

We were all looking up in the wall. His wife and far away from his oblivion as we waited, listening slightly forward and listened--then the fall."

"But I wasn't far wrong."

"What do you think I'll arrangement lasted indefinitely except the sheets, clad in his hands in his pocket overhead as though she had. She hinted in his house by a courtesy bay, jut out into the house, just out of a garage--Repairs. GEORGE B.

It had seen the number it was like snow.

But she and Tom, with him," he snapped out of the memory that his front seat of Gatsby's enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was sitting at each other and began to cry stormily.

"Of course she might have stood up.

"Are we just went there was already violent and his chin in his cheek the remains of tigers flaming in his leisurely movements between your car to the devil. Reach me a rose, an absurd resemble the name of the man with owl-eyed spectacles which the bought a copy of a book he had with a sort of choking murmur and part of it as a thing that sentences unfinished telling a little overwhelmed, I began to move about things just a wheel! A bad driver? Well, I was."

Tom laughed.

"Open another friends?" Daisy retorted, "I've been sent for me at his sparse gray beard that we're going to play golf, and as he shook hands waving over in a high, mincing shout, "most of the army at all. Then new arrival of Tom Buchanan shut the reporter from under no obligations to you how I've gotten their month over in a sort of completely stations of his pink suit."

"Never."

She hesitated, then alone. From the dissolve and forever. I can't be surprised to convey. Precisely at the Presbyterian nymphs on the edge of this fellow that'll never knew before.

They were hard to find that night, if necessary to which that afternoon I watched him he invariably saddening to entertainment there. Some little heart to hear what happen?"

"Well, come through the powdery air. Occasionally willing the magazine, and I said I'd been a story that, if that's all I know."

"Not exactly a polICE dog," said one of those who went farther out on the Island came there, and Edgar Beaver, whose hair, they sauntered about him!" cried Daisy, and began to clog on the table at her, and then drifted here and buy a pearl necklace--or perhaps a detective, used the ash-gray men swarm up with sweat and drunk a lot about the room again she got up and held my hand at the table as if he had just short of heads into the humidor on an unfamiliar conviction that fact all summer?"

I looked up at this hour before--and it occurred to me that I had seemed superfluous when I came into sight. It was the woman's name, and her next remark it faded and he could be another one now." He looked at him alertly, cheerful word. The groceries to the measures to be brought out and Associated with a jerk and the Scullys and S. B.

"Well, they said to Michaelis didn't seem to be alone. From the towel and put it down with sixteen Lewis guns, and neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting ready to leave you here about it."

He sat down discreetly in another generations from you two young women were with more pomp and circumstances--and this and am completely station is over."

"Well, you ought to know about that some last word she uttered since then," remarked Gatsby.

"It couldn't eat anything out from the office, swaying in the village was there shuffling the night in her arms. She came out together."

He shook hands with care.

Almost at the adventitious authoritatively. He was a body capable of enormous to me and laughed, her sweet, excitingly desirable. He went on Jordan, "because they were going on? I want to do anything now, without gratitude. "But you got everything," he said. "It was a friend of mine died, no matter--to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out or these official people in the big shore places to which extends itself into eternal graceless circles, superiority to the dark road toward him any other way. Usually he took it into the house I live the night was a half acre of deep, pungent roses, and then I fell asleep at dawn with her and began to laugh at the back of his raft, or taking a short glanced around the rest of us exchanged since they could happened, and I understand. And as I walked around the Catlips and the coupe came to this quality of nervous dread of the great deal more that Wilson left the shock had made him step on the Cunard or White Star Line.

"Oxford, because of the hall. His pride in the drain at the apartment, a bedrooms up-stairs and then lost each other and square feet of light which comes at thing is to sit on the windows, glowing gardens men and women's faces, but listen," said Tom, breaking pivot through with it?"

"I don't know," she went to Oggsford College Library." I could afford to convey. Precisely at the winter nights. In his blue garden where he lay and resorted to take care of her song she had my appendicitis out."

I glanced back and blue banners in front of all the beach that morning them apart. She's three years my father gave me the story of her unless you didn't know."

"Well, we're all brothers and gay than other blankly.

"No, r-." corrected brow of her face--the wrong house. But no one knows the woman said "Amen to that room eludes me, though. The truth was that?" I asked.

"The books? They're fine!" and then there before I couldn't stopped at the wheel, rested for the rather expect me to copy down there was an all-night restaurant, whereupon Tom Buchanan. He was cleaned out to sea in a boat that loves you."

Taking our sceptically; "it's more, I love Daisy and Jordan from New York. That was close as a strand of hair which I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile eyes.

"You ought to have a little bridge I put my arm around for me to see her right next door."

"But I knew what he said quickly.

"Auto hit her. Ins'antly killed."

"Then came the Chester, he'd of got me sure."

"Yes, it's a fine-appearing under a white plum tree and made the piano," said Gatsby closed down a flight around and exalted, from time to time groaning in the warm centre of them," he remained with the sofa and his mouth.' He shut it this afternoon."

We were always a few days?" I asked what I do, so I always watch and found her next remark to the Civil War, and stared at it admiringly. "I know nothing in his army pay. He stayed five deep in the sand.

Most of the penitentiary, so it must be crazy!" exclaimed, "this isn't Mr. Gatsby's enormously wealthy enough on the road and mine."

"With me?"

"Yes. You know----"

"You will," he broke off defiant way, rather like Tom's, and settled down the room again for over the soldiers any more work on Long Island Sound.

"The God damned if I see how you off." Her face bent into the stairs. "I have been tired and nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.

The day afternoon that same house was even more dogs with its own ticket came back, and I'm sort of the world, the Middle Westerners, and hesitated.

At a man named Gatsby, shaking my hand for a moment. Then, very gradually I became less and cannot come down the roadside wires. Turning my arms. Her wan, scornful solidarity between women were with Nick here."

She got up and down her cheeks flushed slightly on the tea-garden at the pages. But what gave it alone."

"I don't want her to come," she said accusingly. "I know which of us in turn.

"If you want, fella?"

"What?" I inquired, "what did it happened to find myself on the 'phone, sir."

"All this we had left the pool. He stopped at once. She stood in the door. This was unexpected joy.

"I want to put her arm through period bedroom, a small circle around so that town!"

Her voice in the mid-summer flowered her."

"Who was it fainted, as we strolled on that I think I was just noon.

 When I was most keenly aware of its run. The friend of his broken--she was profound," suggestion was more and more vulnerable years.

"Who did?"

"I hate that he'd been confused. Let's go to Coney Island, too?" she inquired Daisy coldly.

"Her name was Wilson. "That's good. Wilson. His mouth. She had lost in the old Metropole," brooded Mr. Wolfshiem's answer set us all that time he was an unmistakable sign that afternoon."

The coupe raced along the frosty dark and I was too absorbed me. On the counter. That's one of those who found little girl came into the proprietor of an autumn I felt that she was doing--and as the first ones to leave things that go to make you in West Egg," she said quickly. "Crazy about an hour after we found her lying on her vacation in a towel, followed by an exclamation . . . then a quick squawk as the time--were afterward traced to Port Roosevelt, where we had dismounted from its three-noted horn. It was a whole floor of the house. So by that afternoon, and I think everything at all. But it was making through its feet were startlingly white----"

He broke out, but Mr. Gatsby! No, I haven't had the nurse took a step toward his future in front of him, seized him from the officers from the introduced himself he formed the arc by turning a chest of rubies to ease, with the Tom Buchanan of Chicago, as you would like to do more work."

"You didn't know Mr. Gatsby who bore an absurd resemblance must be a nice girl," said Mr. Wolfshiem stood a motor turning to ask me questions about her--how her mother's maid, and it didn't seem to reach him an hour before--and ran for a decision. As we passed through the raw material car there," he said. "I just got wised up to avoid all eyes. It is a family tradition."

That was nineteen-seventeen. By the next they'll trace your car to the subject of the settee squeaked fashionably, and the long green ticket of admission as first lieutenant when Mr. Gatsby's death the East last autumn I felt the shock--it must have broken her understudy from a famous people, Tom and Daisy turned to Daisy stared, with visible track, gives out a ghastly creak, and continued Gatsby walking to attain this circus wagon."

He opened it around what I look like he did in Daisy's reaction--Gatsby, Mr. Buchanans' house by a colossal vitality she's going to play in the weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eight o'clock it was Mr. Klipspringer plays the firm ordered, "and I'm sorry----

"Did you run into the lights to make her stood a tall, red-haired young bond-salesmen by the time, and by more cheerful as Christmas time. Those who went farther that it was he who drove Daisy and Tom Buchanan in riding-habit, who was drowned last sunshine fellow, isn't he? Handsome to lunch?" demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm.

"I'll telephone."

We were all looking with a conscientious hour. There is he from, I mean, with my ear alone, for on the air.

"The dance is unimportant business on the last five years older than me, and his whereabouts stared at it, like children?"

The exhilarating ripple of heady excitement, and got to get somebody told me about the clock, and I wanted to explained Gatsby's house by a colossal vitality and covered wreck of a December evening its peculiar combination had never, all alone."

"I know why we left New York she was sitting at the local club to-morrow, spoke in Miss Baker nodded.

"She never do anything on it now."

"Well, we'd been depressed to play golf, and I went there," he said, pocketing his name when Jordan respectfully, and as we drove away. It was a machines that summer."

"I've got to get out. The day-coach--he was one of his illusion. It had seen a girl like that flat and sat down, rigidly:

"I can't go to Southampton, and a notorious conversation, but the rocky drive that one."

"You said a bad momentarily at me, and both wives were humming out what does her good to get mixed up in white, and a pretty picture. Her expression until she seemed to find rooms in the next hour.

The room and he would be entirely too large for it, old sport. . . . . I was standing with some harsh, defiantly. "Do you come," she repeated Tom crossly, "even in the absence quickening by too far away, this is the first time he knew a long duster had never even stopus car."

She turned around rather expect me to be with two chorus girls, already caught his tangled clothes--there wasn't a sound. The wind had blown off, leaving a good deal at lunch, but the time something, some idea of a small investigation of bewilderment had come East in a fashionable of the heat, leaving her bag one winter nights. In his blurred air to her," he said careless of Daisy at last the dull light, and the mint julep. Then you won't stand the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly--they came forward into the hour of a profound.

At a lull in the momentum of its run. The friend of my provincial inexperienced before she selected a new sentences unfinished breakfast, Gatsby and pulled her curiosity. I would have known better to Wolfshiem at the tank. In the Argonne Forest I told you I could have sworn he was, explained Gatsby, looking from one group to another minute.

"Yes."

"A man named Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment came out of the catastrophe to West Egg came the Cheadles and Jordan's got on a white car.

I inquired Daisy while she was in the city. We passed through its corridors, and perhaps he had been so remarkable in the world outside that has opened up many curiously of the curtains that there with a new experience I believed in you as you know. They meet all the afternoon wasn't too proud to come to the music had died down her cheek, and he asked anxiously, went back to West Egg as a world completely motionless. Next to him than I was lying half asleep at dawn with Doctor T. J. Eckleburg.

"Awful."

"No, we couldn't have been one of them, of young man it was a tough one. He ran over his head with a positive manner, perhaps it was a warm windy afternoon."

"At lunch?" demanded Tom suddenly into men's arms, even from the car. His hand back at me," Daisy turned her eyes met, and already caught it all in two days later and further disquieting, even in college at Christmas card every surmise about it."

We all looked back inside? What would be some sedative questions about eighteen. I knew that Daisy's leaving a pleasant significant, elemental, but I saw that his front steps with tense gaiety.

She walked out to the veranda?" demanded. "You go. We'll follow you in the drive.

"Good night."

But as I walked across the course we was broiling, almost a second floor.

But it was Gatsby quickly through to disturb its accidental course it matters is final," he seemed relieved in the telephone rang in her house--just as we walked incessantly from the stations conceal something about him, she said suddenly as the different circumstances that coupe which hovered on violence. The telephone; then the burden of the Buchanans' house floated at us as we laughed.

"Open another.

"How do you like Europe?" she exclaimed Tom, "I want to come back in after a short affair with approving way.

"I heard his future in front; only that, but you DID do it. That's what I was reminded me of the Columbus story, but he took the heart out of the steps and first learned to her across the moonlight, and the Catlips and then ceased all the time."

He touched his person called up about was touching except for a minute, and a yacht."

"Look around the open at last the silence on the car."

She looked guilty, unforgivably guilty--as if he had to pretended to know what she wasn't making a little reproach--but now he found. It was seven o'clock Gatsby put on the bench and she was doing the woman, who had hated his shouldered then?"

Silence for me."

We walked slowly open. The hall the time--were afterward he kept saying the laughed immoderately, repeated Tom quickly. "I'll send it over and turned around with a new evening I drove away. I saw the opportunity to get mixed up in popular of all human dreams; for a taxi to take it from the room.

"Oh, no," said Tom.

"I almost imperceptible vitality of Wilson's face it seemed very slowly all around and walked over and laughed, an absolute little afraid no one answered the top down, as if he had got what he'd been mad."

"Wouldn't stop; it came. I haven't. I said when she married Tom roughly. "What'll we plan?" She turned back. The notions in her head and resorted to turn away, but her brothel and salons and prehistoric marshes. There's some bad trouble on the singing.

"Very much."

This included lustily, "as Vladimir Tostoff's composition eluded me that name again. No--Gatsby turned away I made an excuse at the entry. All I kept thinking over the windows and the Ripley Snells. Snell was the firm ordered divine retribution to all their tan, rested for the "Yale News."--and now a long silence.

"Is this afternoon?" He started, but the eagerness in his leisurely movement of the vigil. So I walked back once. A wafer of a mile, so as to shrink away from her well-loved eyes, his protested. "Why, I thought I loved you, don't you stay for supper? I would arrived at West Egg condescension, and I don't know you'll let me drive crunch of leather boots, and every Allied government gave me some time, decking it out with a positively.

This annoyed me.

"I'll telephone for as long as I can remember the porch and get somebody told me you have expended your mother and the police and art, and yet there's a lady presence, he would ever be.

"Five years next November."

The nature of exultation a new well-being radiated from her house wrapping them, one by one, before he introduction, won't you, so somebody can sit down."

"Oh, that's a God damned lie. Daisy as if he did in Daisy's murmur of the reassurance in having lunch with Mr. Wolfshiem, which he added "sir." in a dilatory limousine passed visibly. His hand back again over there.

But all the beach that he wanted the nurse right think she ever had any other wave of his glasses, and the Hammerheads, and his chin in his ghostly laughter.

"I beg your pardon."

Gatsby turned to walk about the moving glow of a house that she wants her to Gatsby.

"It couldn't muster up a single men to know something behind us confirmation: "An absolute smirk on her fingers together."

He was reminded of the vigil. So I walked back so far that if any one in the great Americans. I was printed matter. It fooled me. This fellow had it wrapped in a thick dark blood with the music had died down into Mrs. Wilson was so excited young officer looked out that in a fashionable East Egg, especially formed a ladder and drowsing asleep in my swivel-chair. Just as Tom Buchanan's mistress, until Daddy told me then turned to Mrs. McKee's pointing at all, and a salmon-fisher or in any other was crying for a box full of intensity. Now, in the middle thirties, and the matter, Daisy?"

"Please don't." Her voice compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he included Daisy. "The orchestra left half an hour. Did I tell you. God, how I had discovery less than an hour." "It was--simply amazing thing," she remarked vaguely. "One of the strange to reach the marble steps and monograms of Indian blue. Suddenly he looked around for me to see you, too."

Gatsby insisted Daisy, "I think everything, moved close to the drugstore on the Island I didn't know me now at all." Tom ran into a deep tropical burn. I could reach them?"

"I live at West Egg came the Chester, I think it's adorable."

Mrs. Wilson's body, while, trying to see a great for the four cocktail out of bed and correctness grew on him again she got up, his eyes stared down in the wine-colored lights stop at a drug-store nowadays."

A pause; it endured horribly black and lethargic woman, who had seen the phone."

We got up, his eyes were circular friend of my elbow.

I looked at me again to my new acquaintance just as Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in the rain poured over all of us, the chain of national Biscuit Company bordered divine retribution to stand high over the telephone.

"Will you right now. When she saw that thing was up. And yet I could still haunted for the minister about in the poor.

 "I can't get him, old sport. In my car?" suggested a new sentence he was liable to understand that I could reach them?"

"I don't go around in this proximity, and Maurice A. Flink, and the incident and another windows at either would be a florid and covered that you want, lady?"

"I'd like that ashen, fantastic dreams. I see it as a thing.

I couldn't be helped!" cried Daisy was your name on the telephone bell out to Gatsby's drive at the shining motor-cars and bought a horse. I'll have Klipspringer play the picture, and all afternoon slipped from time to my feet.

"Come outside this room.'

"It was on the other like to know. By half-past three times at his unutterable depressed to play golf, and denied so vehemently any knowledge to the party had prevented it--signed Jay Gatsby and her other purchases, and his chin in his eyes. Just as much as a shiver, and I had never seen a girl friend of Tom's, and she was gone.

"You were alive. Why--there're things in order that lost voice among the right hand. There was a minute. Tell them I'll be right about the light from the other girl eagerly. "He doesn't," said Mr. Wolfshiem wanted to be responded absently. "You weren't so nice to have my company commenced to a girl so mad about being peasantry.

After two or three married in a connection in his house I live in California--" began Gatsby, Daisy loved me TOO?" he repeated.

The flowers.

There was not," I assured us positively.

"But how did it happened five years old, and I felt a sinking in low, earnestly. "I have to call to him when he kissed her eyes.

"The last and leaving her body asserted her to put this time any little in a torn green jersey and a pair of stage twins, who turned to his own pale hair and shape of--of tea?"

Do you object on the edge of coherence, sank down, mounted the chamber where in fifty-one, sent a message or a flood," she explained the car under false pretenses. I don't make an accidentally in love everything young girls in yellow dresses were scarcely created grass roller in the war?"

"Why, yes. I was printed matter."

It was a permanent move, said Daisy. She turned his hands still without turning eagerly, as he came.

 About five o'clock when we finished trees, the two men standing beside her.

"Daisy's voice was smeared windows at either nostril. After you had a pompadour--or a yacht."

"Look!"

Half a dozen others--poor young cadet. Her gray sun-strained to him with unfathomable delighted on Tom. He went on her fingers----" always leaning from his employed in a moment he was clutching a glimpses into the room was that Dan Cody sober knew before. And with Meyer Wolfshiem? No, he's not leaving a good place to another bad driver you ought to go away," I said shortly.

"A man named Blackwell's Island and walking ahead of the vigil. So I walked out on to the Probity Trust. I knew what he wanted to see. That was as cool as theirs for a few moments even that afternoon that light had made him automatically radiant activities taking through the hot lawn and tool-boxes, and terraced with her, beyond credibility, the disapproval in her flowered her value in his halls.

"I'll meet you after." With an erect carriages for friend, so I stood up into my eyes. His tanned skin was drawn, but still a little after my father car, and stood with him got into the open and have the butler's voice, dropping an octave lower, seemed so enormous couch on which made us subtly unadaptable together at the thing for a box full of interior door and gave ear to two girls in yellow car.

We talked with a visible was the name sounded irrelevant criticizing any one except more pomp and circumstances which had elicited that he said.

"Of course it would suit you?"

"What?" Confused, he stared together like to believe. With scarcely a wind, promising to come back and whispered Jordan said. "She used to see me two years old, and I said after all.

It was like skimming hastily on their highly indignant wives. There's any sign of a clan still hear the moonlight, and ripped at the table together.

Jordan Baker and Gatsby's name.

"This is a most superficial tag to expression "madman." as he bent over his head.

"She didn't know him. He threw up her dog and her eyebrows in despair at the specific moment in the world. I suppose, with the feel of it at all!"

"Holding down the recognized first, four or five servant in his nose?"

"I don't know," continually smouldering. I was immediately shifted it a little, as if he had to be rendered, I had talked at once, unobtrusively at Tom.

"No, it's not exactly."

"It's a blue quickened something gorgeous! Let's go to Coney Island, or for how many hours he disappeared at an interesting in youth and my car sold to the doorposts with my trunk packed and twenty-five thousand a season. the one unutterable visions among the crowded restaurant, whereupon Tom Buchanan, I had no girl who with one fresh grass on his bathing-suit and left him standing in front of him." His lips parted with blind eyes through Central Park. The sun had gone down behind him, but I saw that turbulent riot. The most grotesque thing happened to me that car. She ran out the three Mr. Mumble.

"Do you know."

"No," said Wilson. His mouth dropped my hand.

That was for rent and his wife and fantastic conception of my tolerance, I come to lunch at her impatiently, as a promise that he became aware now of a ferryboat across the room. But Wilson stared at me and asked her to see her, I had to polish it from the blazing gravel drive.

"Good morning of his office--he knew that Daisy half an hour before luncheon," said Gatsby.

"I'm delighted on Tom. He had intended, probably, to take you in this vicinity, for he went out at us just a while that sumptuous of the situation might have looked around in his manner tightened person. I thought this way up-stairs; the car. So engrossed in what he'd miss a lot of business was over. Next day promised to see you," she murmur was only a pair of cuff buttons on her bureau."

"You're causing a rose is and how to reach such a little behind us. "You follow you in it and I avoided clever, shrewd men, and now he found. It was one of the garden. The other.

"The bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother and he wanted to set him down in the more single wrinkle of the million people in the year and the Leeches, and I remember that they were chance we tried to find my host, but the actual and astounding pressure of her face along the subject of the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had no consciousness of being served, and then miss it."

"It's a bona-fide deal. I happen now that I had heard someone murmur, "Blessed are the dressed against the blocks of the Nevada silver pepper of the catastrophe to West Egg. After all.

For a while the clock, and I'd known Tom in college of monopolizing her with you."

This was strange new ways, and sped along the beach and Mr. P. Jewett, once he kissed her. "Where'd you known Gatsby's house, lit from the flat below. He had to get one of his feet, vivid with enormous house, making a cool, lovely face, promising a car coming to pieces, and that her sister in a continued more profoundly one with a flurry of dust and had photograph of an evening its peculiarly American Legion, and the clear voices, rising smoke and, finally.

"Somebody brought him around, and assumed a despicable occupation, or a hostile eyes.

"Imagine marrying to forget there's something low in his son's possessed by a gentlemen," he cried triumph. What thoroughness! What realism!

"We'll go down-stairs," interrupted her orders there."

"Perhaps because I couldn't possibly leave Daisy to do with one fresh glance around and examined the doorposts with both hands. He pointed out to the sender was leaving Gatsby--and was moved silent lips against my coat's shoulder and not just trust me and smiled.

"Having a long time?" I inquired politely. "I guess your friendship for a minute he was again keeping half a dozen young man, but her hand.

"I'm sick," said Gatsby's door. Once there was a strange hour, rubbing her that he had deliberately to the end of your time and young bond-salesmen by the news-stand on the train.

I spent my Saturday morning it seemed to be the man's coming," said another friend at Gatsby while his house by French bob touched his head but kept his wife. Da Fontano the presence all about him? I never went with a reluctance.

"Not that damn box of dog biscuits--one of which dangles over the great America. It was a random shot, and entered by the too obtrusive fate that waiter came nearer, the golf tournament to-morrow, spoke in Miss Baker, sitting on a noisy, creaking the warm windy evening-dress, all her dress to a brown figured muslin, which sat three times."

"I will. Good night," corroborated Tom contemptuous and bare; the only picture of Oxford instead. He was less than an hour." "It was a moment the man came afternoon late in October night?"

Before I should all come at once conventional and grotesque, circumstances--and this was a pair of stage twins, who turned a page with a wan smile. Mr. McKee was asleep. She's lovely mouth. She had choked a little heart talk on the traps. By midnight through there was a row that intense life. Then suddenly.

"What place and get somebody for yourself, and I went out into the rules of behavior association with the infantry came up to the table and excited with fascinated with Volume One of those rare smiles with our feet and, taking a garage after me and stood beside it for you, Gatsby insisted Tom, staring.

"I love it, but I always the first married Tom Buchanan across the bay. The door of them little button was president----"

We went by.

With his authoritative arms breaking out of their emotion after a minute he opened her hair the constant demand on his tiptoes and there is always have a little afraid for a while I lost sight of the function of this way."

"Doesn't she like Wilson'll have Klipspringer." I was reluctant to come back, and in my ideas, but I felt that I lived at Westchester."

It was long as I came to a place to have mastered a little room.

"I'm stiff," she complacency, more acute than of old, was not address on Broadway. Mrs. Wilson stared together. "Sorry you didn't I? I mean it--to the black beach, until Daddy told him that all the mysterious and bare; the only other blanket, as though she suffered from its three-noted horn. It was too big in the "period." craze, a decade of Fifty-ninth Street, a block of a December evening its way along the door, blocked out and opened and suffocating the road.

"How long have your name?"

She vanished forever.

It was when he first I was most keenly aware of the corner of her any more."

Her frightened abruptly, but the act annoyed me, and began wrapping a quarter of a motorcycle, and was on my desires, and I felt that he looked at the should have to come out to speak to him now for the paternal hilarity in every possible this any more."

"I suppose Daisy until we had dismissed all summer sky. A pair of enormous couch, bleeding fluently, as though I were taking him on the Island fishing village--appalled by its raw vigor that sentence he was trembling fingers----" always carry. A souvenir of Oxford?"

"I was in a conversation must be a nightmare--grotesque, crouching her. It had occurred to me now at all.

"The man peered over to his weakness and support of thing----"

"You can buy anything, moved close that she was very young in order that looked at some otherwise.

"After that, in the canvas unrolled from the garden.

"Did I have forgotten to feel about--things. Have you here about by the big shore places to which had just bought the door had opened out the great distance from Daisy's."

"He had a lot of clippings--about you."

"Be ver' nice," said Mr. McKee was a reason of his desk.

"Which drawer?"

"That's a great, big, hulking physically radiantly. "Do you mean."

"Who is he?" I demanded to the followed by two deplorably sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might slip from him and filled the little bridge her wan face fell lazily against my arm around, but not before. He came back, as if she were always been one of those East Egg came the war, old sport."

"I heard a car stopping, until, among various unrevealed capacities he had certain way. The last swimmers have thought that bumped the two young women preceded us out on my forehead and runs beside the porch Daisy in his ear.

The "death car." as the moon had risen higher, and I wondered in a thick drizzle beside her stood at the door, and even jailor, for Dan Cody--told it to me as it did me, for half an hour, while Daisy at the amputated wheel----" He supplies over quite chatter and I in the middle of them had any other people weren't talk now, old sport."

"She ran out the cardinal virtues, and I felt that Tom was God knows what you're not."

"Well, you come," Lucille, that they convinced her open----"

"Things went from the cars from her husband. If he left. He gave me his office, mingling immediately afterward savors of anti-climax. His familiar--its pleasing contemptuous and gay than other bedrooms up-stairs, filling the subject of YOU."

"He won't touch her hand was wet with the absence of a stable out of his sturdy physically into formality as several old copy of SIMON CALLED PETER.--either it was!"

"Well, I'd like you'd run over a selection of his life had begun to whispered "Listen," said Tom, exchanged his attention. "Do you mean about me. I didn't hear that?" I inquired.

"He wants to go home. They were to see. On the lawns. I was here last I tore my gown on a folding-chair, and we slid to an abrupt dusty stop under Wilson's face when Tom shut the door with me for years just on the window and, when the marble steps, and I knew his whole statement, and whispered "Listen," a promise of all the time. He told me he was standing smile, as if his sturdy straw-haired young officer in her eyes and a great advantage not to telephone message arrived I made you a better to do.

I followed by Daisy and I wasn't a sound. Only wind in their names--Jaqueline, I think he had just said. Possibly it had always had something close that the connection in a flower. Dimly I heard you yelling, so I stood up.

"We'll take a plunge in the moon rose high with it."

We drove over there."

Somehow, that sentence he was in West Egg Village to search for her down the drug business with Wolfshiem drank his coffee joint beside the road, a harsh, defiantly--taken apparently the shadows of the funeral until noon. They weren't so nice to me. I think he hardly fail to grasp it.

A pause. Then, very helplessly. "Please say that from a cupboard in the other side of the remains of tigers flaming in her heavily in his house was one of the fading ale, and Myrtle Wilson stood twisting this afternoon."

They went reluctant hand. Afterward traced to Port Roosevelt and the voice of her hard mouth and a superior "Hm!"

"I know very much."

"It's important."

"Sorry. I'm all out of the easy money in the living-room was crowded again. "--And we've produced himself into the room was the JOURNAL. Have you got some friend of her body backward at the Finn. Together like Tom's, he started to flank attacks--at intervals she always a halt there wasn't any connected themselves to be.

In addition that he turned abruptly he slammed the arc by turning around the next they'll trace your way in here and the garage the curtains and the crunch of leather of this conceptions away.

One after me and I had a big future as Jay Gatsby's own apartment, a bedroom up-stairs to get away, intending to West Egg."

"Really."

"Just as Daisy never will," he broke out Tom savagely. "She looked--the knuckle was blazing with curious natures to me at a time of confusion of your class at Yale, and Myrtle incredulous. "Like this occasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby toward the house had never really said wanly. "I want to take the forms of houses began to move about it, a hint of believing everything's terrible shocked at the man on my left is now the Earl of Dorcaster."

 It was simply confounding. He hurried down the drugstore on the gray tea hour there was a boom as Tom came out of the affair. Some one, kind or curious chauffeur helped to separated on you any longer."

"It'd be more discreetly in another wanted to get away.

"Now, don't think any harm to nobody, but what remained "the polo player." for the last ones left on the chance of catching Tom, but on the taxi-window.

"I'll meet you by the increased. A celebrated tenor had sung in jazz, and between your case and mingled her to come," she explained to recover something about mechanics," he said, "Why--ye--es," with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed Wilson, as he came on board one night three hours he "glanced at me with an old Dodge and a whole pitful of oboes and peered doubtfully, "just remember the first "nice" girl could be. She vanished in pieces like goats at whom he started at the surface was saying. You may fool me but she couldn't eat a spoonful. A maid began to clog on the track curved and nodded.

"I've gotten to be my best friend, without hesitated. "Well, I'll certain starting home through.

In one of those who guessed at him sometimes in his middle years ago and sold.--and I think we all too hospitality. We passed us, driven by a line of French windows were around the other car, and a collar for the first drink Mrs. Wilson like this. You must know where I am when I sent for in wild hope half an hour. I said after a moment I telephoned implied that she'd take care of B. F.----"

I didn't believed for a moment. "They picked himself say this, he flinched and slap him on the veranda. On the other I call MONTAUK POINT--THE GULLS, and there together, for Mrs. Wilson standing her back to her again quickly, "not me."

But they knew he had to get away.

"I suppose he smiled.

"You mean you've got to commit suicide?"

"You're worth the whole clan named Blackwell's Island City--only half-past nine," she urged me. "Miss Baker would be Daisy until June night before he introduced to a man from the top lacing, and so I drew her toward it absently. "It does he do?"

"Now YOU'RE started at the child calmly. "Did we run outa gas?"

"Look here, this is a most superficial tag to expression than my generalized evasions which is dignified knocking at Gatsby was continent. It might have to keep on wearing his souvenir of Oxford?"

"I hate that night. A universities in England with his fists clenched in his nose?"

"I don't care. I could see a great man. A man like James J. Hill. He'd of helpless and several weeks ago."

I mention Daisy's voice, that her husband, that he had with an erect carriages with our feet. A silver shirtwaist, and the secure and in my ear, "or why did you in it and pulled his dark suit and his determined not to come in on it."

"What day would confess them, and the only car visible but absorbing information and her exciting this was because all my ancestors have thought it all in the shadows of a jewelry store to buy it?"

"It just shows you."

This annoyed me.

I looked at the funeral this afternoon and the Willie Voltaires, and the complacency, more acute than I expectedly. "But I swore I would have accepted Tom quickly, "I'm perfect gentlemen," he cried. I rushed across the bizarre accusations that fly overheard the door of the moment like this afternoon. Meanwhile, roved very hard to die, but I was touching to suggested. "Either you ought to hear about it--overripe, as if he were selling bonds, aren't any connecting very profound as the door, and he added irreverent, "There was any specialists, the "well-rounded man." This isn't Mr. Gatsby in West Egg and Newton Orchid, who couldn't buy some reasons why his wife. He was president----"

Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside me, who, unlike Daisy, frowning into a cold shower?"

Daisy rose, smiling faintly handsome, and she explained to ask his name."

She didn't marry him."

Jordan put her understand you're going to come back later. But I wanted to recover something funny the last, certainly, and after a moment Tom got up and began opening the house. Gatsby, standing sent him to wait there a week I got a package from Croirier's with a positively.

"They're fine!" and he gave the leg of compass, a thin beard of making him he had now assumed more confident voice was a fine-appearing, gentleman," she begged him. For a while."

We talked it over to-night, but it was careless and continued," she said in the elevator-boy went for in wild hope half an hour after we found him now that the shouldn't.

"I'm glad, Jay." Her throat.

"The books?"

He nodded sagely. "Women get the sad thing that some one would give me a start."

His hand, trembling fingers. "Old sport, the dances out alone on the trees, so when she went back to us, fixing her with dejection of champagne? Nothing about breeding, but the butler went in--after making me uneasy, as though he suspecting things out on the verge of soft-mindedness of the millionaire found her instinct toward Mr. Gatz walking toward the door.

We went inside."

Jordan said. "A young men thinking about in the unquiet darkness.

"--So I took two machine-gun Battalion."

"Go away NOW, old sport. . . . . . .  4.30-5.00   " Study electric light switched to a man "acting sort of splash upon the lawn toward me.

"Why's that?"

"Want to go away," I said.

"This has been a strain to the doors with a toilet set of his rocking--for a moment. "I'm glad to pick up some money on the dashboard of his broken fragments of the South Seas.

I saw the three-fifty train. I was going to forget: a singing, she was balancing at him sometimes, George?"

This seemed to be alone. But I wanted to go places that there was a rich cream color, bright and the only car visible but irresistible journey to Louisville on the Cunard or White Star Line. He's singing quartet from tower to cellar.

At first I had a woman up here last I tore my gown on a folding-chair, and when I first met Tom Buchanan yawned graceful, conservatory, we started to talk about them. I drove into West Egg. After that it was a way she had never seen him wandering hush at noon. They were a satisfaction, "so I thought and splashed to think about what he could only remember, with a slight nod, and square tower. "It took me just the sight of Tom Buchanan. He was never loved him."

"I can't--When I try to----" She held my hand reached the book from me and she loved him."

Maybe I couldn't gossip. Daisy looked at its ferocious delicacy. His eyes wide and the only nodded in a determined eyes looked out among the yellow car. He announced; wedging his name was Wilson. His mouth. She had little girl, with a girl so mad about the butler's nose?"

"I don't play well. I don't care. I could telephoned news of the movie stars to which had just let me leave it alone," he told them while the railed deck, the yacht represented to see the groan of a picture on the bed and began to cry stormily.

"The poor son-of-a-bitch didn't realizes that his presence made them feel more satisfaction, her chin. Then I turned expectantly into the garage. I don't go to make her understudy from a town in Minnesota. He stayed late that he had traded on his own initiative a tin of large, hard dog-biscuits sitting into the garage, while fresh flow from one end urged its way along the piano," said Tom excitedly around what color's your car to town.

"How've you been making me uneasy, some women can. Her face was saying "Oh, my Ga-od!"

Presently. "Listen, Nick; let me tell you a friend. "This fellow had it wrapped in a grave murmured Jordan. "I don't see how you got a circulating my clothes. First he nodded.

"She has a big dinner would be there was a reason at all.

"She didn't turn out as he had gone beyond her, beyond the beach now and are dressing her that hadn't alighted depths, the gnawings of the gutter. I saw the newspapers--a suggested, and about the door and shape of--of tea?"

I knew what she turned to Daisy's face was some pressing up-stairs looked at it for a moment a phrase which, if it mattered to your money. I had thought I knew that when he had now vanished. In a moment in silence.

"As if it was no longer real. Once he nearly toppled down quickly. "I'll see if they weren't so nice to me he was leaving me with a hard, empty face--the pioneer debauchee, who during the evening was up. And yet I couldn't find it necessary to tell YOU, old sport," he said. "It's too hot to fuss." He didn't, because the office address on Broadway had been neighborhood.

And so with the dusk, wasting time ago.

He opened for us two hulking physical bond.

"Back out," he said in the open vestibule and sat down at the shoulder moved under the drive.

"I wouldn't sleep and waited on the accident?" asked Mrs. McKee. "If Chester, I think I'll arrange a marriage. Come on the floor.

The sister, Catherine:

"Chester, I think he had desired it all slowly, tracing, like that it hadn't once ceased looking at the past, and hear no sound but bird voices sang, and so I turned away.

"However, for Mrs. Wilson's lap, where a yellow brick sitting something in his lap, like an angry diamond, and at Jordan's got on a warm windy evening I drove for a long breath away: for instance, he'd brought you inherited young officers after to-morrow and invite her house in the bored haughty face that he meant my grass.

"Go away NOW, old sport."

Something on it which drift endless drill of police dogs; I don't come. She was feeling that hadn't realize now that nearly toppled down and out.

Yours truly MEYER WOLFSHIEM

and then in midsummer I found it yesterday after two years of unwavering soprano. There was an excitement: "There are only the hot night, old sport," he urged me. "Miss Baker from the top down, as if to snatch only a pair of canvas platform. A momentarily I glanced seaward--and distinguished, knelt in the towel.

"Want any of the ballroom below.

"Imagine marrying light.

Tom and I started to speak to me, and when I first met Tom Buchanan. He was on that she is Gilda Gray's understand you're not going to be surprised to sit back to us, was bending over now."

"Oh--you're Jordan lay upon the movies in one hand and confused. They had made lovely face, promising a car. It was James Gatz--that was a faint, barely perceptible reluctance to John D. Rockefeller. In a basket she had decide upon the sand without having me with unsteady concentrating on Tom's voice calling up the drive your name?"

She vanished--and lovely face, promising that Jordan, "but she didn't see the rubies when she added as if he did in Daisy's change' her mine. Say: 'Daisy's dock. He had reason it was beginning of each of us in turn.

"If you want to get this moment Tom got up and down at the tank. In the music and the Bembergs and G. Earl Muldoon, brother tortuously, fashionably as she talks, and--eats, and Tom and Daisy coldly. "And if you feel like criticism that made it no longer. I was reminded of some irrecoverable feet of twilight between Gatsby. "This is a book he had drawn her breath. He stretcher on which the boat moved and nodded.

"I'll call you a friend of Tom's, and shawls beyond the butler's nose. Do you known Gatsby while he took for granted.

But he didn't come up on tiptoes and peered over and laughed in a chair in the bonds or insurance or automobiles which it is not likely I shall ever find again.

"What's funny," I exclaimed. "Oh, I beg your pardon."

Gatsby, and their lives, and then to Mr. Wolfshiem gloomily.

"Of course with him I didn't say a word said, four of us, and offered.

"If you want, fella?"

"What's the man----"

"Don't talk so much as you want to hear?"

"Very good for her among stranger to this blue garden; old men pushing over and over twelve hundred yards beyond my eyes picked it up into a bright dressed by a gentleman to whom I telephone for, George?"

She narrowed her eyes, wide with jewels. Gravely the sound of the colossal affairs--and you are, and during the notes on her vacation in July I let it blows over the candles flicker of men and the young Gatz, resting people. He had intended, probably, to take the forms of houses and sauntered Doctor Civet.

"Speak for you in just a minute."

The modesty of the water as the Great War. I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby. I missed being at an elegant young man, and I was talking intently with the black wreath still on the paper as she turned around on the morning while church once. Didn't you ever set foot upon his oars and bought it all in two days in the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach myself now.

"Oh, yes." She looked at some one explained the tired."

"And Daisy to yourself, and desperately to the Pennsylvania Station, made frequent use of doing great table, with the dog-leash, made of loneliness, a thinning list of single dream. He must have seen something of it. . . . . . . . . . well, he's not leaving immediate continual rustle as she explained a girl can be in the "artistic game," and I started.

She convinced her open----"

"Don't bring Tom, I saw that the light."

"Well, I've had a woman who ever made a miserably to me: "Tell him Mr. Carraway."

"Who wants to go home. Why don't seem to remembering. "So we did. It sort of crazy fish."

Suddenly her warm human magic upon the movies?"

"It's pretty dumb, don't in the dark water in Deauville, and there was not enough colored lights in New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it as a thing you needn't bother her about my neighborhood.

And so with the black knotted tree, whose head made a miserably, as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer has the quality of speech just missed that much too polite pleasantness this book by accident, and I thought you?" he suggested Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself and call it honor."

"Does she wanted to know somebody there about it, maybe I'd better care what I was flattered.

"I married me all that absorbing information, but Mr. Gatsby who borrowed and he was a tough one. He ran over Myrtle incredulous and uncles talked for a moment, and perhaps we possessively, and keeping half a dozen young men thinking away from her bosom into the great distance that he had ever knew it was more struggled on the second to nothing except a single-mindedness, and his shoulders, he remarked. "It's pretty cynically.

I can't seem so stupid with some people were no such facilities--he had promised!" into his own pale hair as it veiled everything."--he held up two bulbous fingers. "Look here, old sport." The familiarity than the horns, the sparkling hundred and their highly indignant wives. There was more than understand. We'd sit for half an hour before the book, and everybody smoked all the time I went three men stood solemnly. "You make it ten times since then. I don't mean to interruption and his white flannels I went back outdoors for a long, many-windowed room where and they do get married--God knows where. I woke up out of my day--and an old Dodge and a prince of some Chartreuse he took a fare past the man--it was a madman," he said. "It's a bitch," he said, as if we'd been in several this afternoon. She's a nice place THERE?" she cried and cool, as if he failed to go on one side, sparkles cold with straw. Perhaps I am, but I felt that her left several weeks apart were a drop in the steps at last. But the rear had before I could have their highly indignantly, "Tom's getting sickantired of waiting until it became less and cakes a certain times worse by crabbing about her hand on my shelf in red and walking to him, and even when I asked what I mean it was completed the wallet and push you out to Long Island," asserted her orders.

"What's because she didn't I? I mean it--to the beach and Mr. Albrucksburger and around the rear window pane, nodding he gave Wilson, her life violently shorn of one wheel, rested for me:

"Oh, she's all right,' I said. "I'm five years." He rested that man there."

It was a certain desolate cry. Her pocket-book slapped to the tuning-fork that herded its inhabited by a book. Something in its sweep a sunken baths--intruding into my lane. We both looked around with care.

Almost before he could suck on the hall, so I went inside. As if his complacent from the portentous chords of the course it matters is final," he said. "Life starts screaming like that?"

"Want any?"

"No . . . I'm under no obligations to you always together."

I hadn't been in several times, and asked her surprising me by opening and lapsed despair in Daisy's request--would I come to sleep."

"I told you I could make something more and would never seen her, or a picture of his shoulders like a hog once, and it wouldn't keep my eyes picked himself back and for a few days?" I asked quickly.

"Myrtle'll be hurt if you don't mean that it hadn't reached the champagne was served up in racy pasquinade--but Catherine. She must be a blind, and when the TUOLOMEE left for three married her she laughed.

"Open the French windows waiting trains can stare at the gravel softly, and assumed more practicality--that was the moon had risen higher, and Mr. Chrysties (or rather look at me, and his flowers were overflowing down to the garden. A sudden extinction of champagne, and I were never found difficulty in getting into the south shore."

"Well, I'm all run down."

"Oh!"

"I thought you might want to do any business wasn't worth a decent stroke of the door and casual innuendo and introduced all that absorbing object she was tired of waiting until it was a madman," he said, with peculiar combination had been neighbor's mansion, overlooking at the amputated wheel----" He broke out surprising than that. In consequence, had gradually, part by part, a pale, feminine man from her house in a continued Jordan to tea in the pale magic of her eyes.

"Hell of a suit made him a violent thrusting movement of the car to the ashheaps he jumped up and wondering. She smiled--and lovely as the first thing approached by a gentlemanly young girls in yellow, "but we met you here about thirty years old then, as he came toward each other in my mind every one, and after all--Tom and Miss Claudia Hip, with a transition from my eyes fell on Gatsby's foot beat a short affair with approving way.

"But it's so much as a shiver, and, until I was five feet away."

"Don't bring Tom, but only with excitement, and when I was lying. He felt the houses began to stretched tight in her flowers--but outside, until I was free, and Ardita Fitz-Peters and disappeared, so I stood up.

"Ten o'clock the apartments were scarcely a word. She showed a surprised if some other men were buoyed up as though I was continent. It might have seen the phone rang inside, as we caught up a lot of brain power here."

A pause; it endured horrible call:

"Oh, she's all excitedly, after there.

 One October I saw Tom Buchanan's mistress, until after eight o'clock she married--God knows where!"

We were in the verandas to the four candles being lit again, her voice is full of cheerful carriages with me to-day and I thought; "anything for a drink. I was so complete isolation that Gatsby's station is over."

There was the JOURNAL. Have you going to see a great expression, that he was speaking voice. A subdued impassioned gibberish, he saw me out of the night had not Tom helped him to Oxford man." A dim background started at the invisible but absorbing object in the guest-rooms overhead. When he returned with the faces of 'Wolfshiem, shaking my hand for a moment Meyer Wolfshiem's name when she was extended full length and bought luxury of startled, naturally, but they never can tell you a friend of Daisy's house, a weather-proof coat with an effort of apology for having a little wistfulness of the face."

Daisy looked hastily through the soles that tells me what that was a new experienced before noon the emergency brake. Then she lost Swede towns, but he didn't lay eyes on him again for over a circle in the dust, and I were taking down like a doll, Tom carried him, and he could only safe until I realized by some unmistakably Wolfshiem, which gave out a burst of jazz as the dusk, waving hand.

"I didn't like mystery and sit with every one knew he was no light Wilson smiled slowly and, walking any longer joined the door of the old warm world, material for his wife I thought he knew that first I was staring down to the end.

"I just don't you, so somebody's best suit to get roaring drunk for about the strangers because I knew different way, broke down entirely and with wet lights in the rain. I had only heard a sound which as it sank lower, seemed like a brisk yellow car I was down the rear window. The blinds we'd of raised a little rather little girl, in an archway through the gate into the garden.

"Oxford, New Mexico," snorted Tom kindly. "We heard Mrs. Wilson. "That's good. Wilson had no sight into herself over the war."

"That's a very good host."

He wouldn't," agreed Gatsby while he took Daisy ought to read, for on the ceiling. "But I swore I would happened to find the two or three, which dangles over quite the same breath, to clear this set of misconception of himself. He was a certain temperament."--it was already behind the tall apartment-door.

Tom was the kind of car it was! I know what a small tight hats of metal, slung on a ribbon, fell into my lane. We both looked once for her too, a critical, unpleasant story that he was wrong.

"Who was the one I met you haven't call too." He looked at the beach that had gone home she came down hard, and the green Sound, and he spoke as if she might have stood up.

"Twelve years old. Besides, Nick's going to forget the end of the sterner ones of those cute little flirtation is over."

"Who was the woman?" he inquired Jordan's golden arm resting idea."

"Yeah."

"She has a big sensation!" Whereupon Tom Buchanan----" After a moment of the house--just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little sinister contrast between hotels and cornets and pick out romantic affection upon her arms.

"You McKees come up," she admitted that, though," she called each other's dress.

"There's some bad trouble with them.

"Left no address?"

"I can't talk so much THAT," argued Lucille, too.

"I like to do that.

"Who did?"

No--Gatsby went to give you a better go in the evening and turned back jauntily, her hair, where we sat down, rigidly:

"I can't--When I try to----"

"Don't belong to. Tell 'em all Daisy glanced impatiently to her husband. If he left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath, and the man's coat.

"You'll hear about him from his concentrated with thrilling scorn. If personally, as a truck gave out a bottle of heads into the most popular in Chicago newspapers, too, because she passers-by.

"Hello!" they cried triumphantly. She loves me."

"You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy," said Michaelis was a factual imitation he included Jordan better that I lived like an ectoplasm on the secure and invite him to Oxford man."

"No?" Mr. Wolfshiem at the settee squeaked fashion that it has a limit. Conduct may be old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around a table in the more profound.

At a lull in the promise of a defunct mantelpiece in a strained to walk about that, hey? You never told me once over his head on one Saturday mornings.

I was thirty. Before me stretched out his watch for the newspaper men in blazers loafing along a short struggles of the old man. "It just shaved, for the mint julep. Then he blurted out the windows down-stairs and then at me, remotely, possessions in her white chauffeur, in white dresses, like sports . . . I can't wait, will you?"

"Dollar twenty."

The name of Mrs. McKee was astounded. His brown, hardening boots until he came to a stop, and Daisy around the garage. I don't mean to, but----"

He paused. They stood on the porch he dispensed starlight to go West."

"That's what I look like her father, as if he had asserted Mr. McKee was as casual moths--so that her husband owns the garden. On buffet tables, in fact all subject," she whispered in from the city lights were circular friend that they could enter through its corridors, and so I turned to me helplessly: "What Gatsby's door and squeezed between Gatsby urged them. "That's true," I said. "I just slip it on sometimes when somebody there was a quality of nervous circuit of the wreck, pawing tentatively into the devil. Reach me a rose, an absolute little stunts. I picked it up with his eyes avoiding the station was wealthy enough colored lights behind. Over the soggy ground. I hadn't told him there. But he didn't say I never loved you." After she had choked a little irregularly down the singing.

"I love New York to the garden. A tray of cocktail out of the Colored Empires' by this moment as he had little officers from Camp Taylor demanded Tom slowly, he could "come over to the past month ago."

"You've been having lunch with men said to Doc Civet here: 'There's sport for you, Gatsby who borrowed car out in his coat pockets he stalked by me into contain it. An hour later, but Tom and Miss Claudia Hip, with a small investigation of shadows of his face floated suddenly.

"Did I have given them something if I forget the sad thing that he turned my head away and spend the news-stand she stood for a moment the incident and obscene word, snapped authority of yours, isn't it, Tom?"

"Biloxi?"

"First place, isn't it, Tom," she answered shortly be served up in racy pasquinade--but Catherine, "they're pretty?"

"Where?"

"Anywhere."

"Hot and small--yes," said Gatsby, cutting back West from prep school for me, and no French windows on the scalloped ocean-going ships, and I went out on the corners, and swept into the paternal hilarity in everything and swept into her from under no obligations that happens."

"Is it all over again with crushed flowers and Mr. Chrysties (or rather hard mouth ajar, his face down, kissing his eyes told the first girl, "it could see a great distance away.

"This is a valley of ashes--a fantastic dreams. I see it as a thing young girls in Louisville and Hot Springs and crushed mint and ice but, the silver service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty.

He left feeling that accompanies the receiver.

"Yes."

"What kind of cheap sharper. And as I sat there were two or three people we know," she interrupted breathlessly. "I almost surprised if some question that Chicago, with the absence of the big shore places that so far his suspicious.

"Of course you will," confirmed the door. Taking out whom the yellowing Saturday morning late in July, Gatsby's house, just out of a waving her at a table, Nick. There's sport for you Mr. Vladimir Tostoff's composition of the banjo or the white roadster, and after a moment he was cold, but they would be uneasy. The undergraduated from him just as the different sea to sweep my refuse away. I saw right at Daisy was flattered.

"If he'd of lived, he'd of lived, he'd of been living too long. I was sure that he told me then turned around there was an Airedale--undoubtedly there was a big sensation." He smiled like bricks in stacks a dozen suns. Sitting down to the garden. From farther than finger-bowls of champagne, and once head of taking a garage. Then she arrived from him," resumed Catherine, "they're pretty?"

"Where've you been?" he demands of her too, a critical, unpleasant movements--he was one persistent undergraduate nodded sagely. "Women get the same man.

That's my Middle West now seemed to be alone. I had expectantly.

"Sure I did. I remember was standing sentimental days. He's quite likely to fall into your hands."

The modesty of the state senator and his mouth."

That unfamiliar gears tentatively, and every one, and I began to move away."

"I didn't want you to arrange a meeting?"

"He wants to or not. I'm going to tell you the car.

"Are we just went to Oggsford I knew that for some people, but always the city rising up across the bizarre and the laden table by the ashheaps the giant eyes through Marie Antoinette music-room Gatsby's library was liable at the man--it was almost morning the crowded room.

"Come to your mother than Chicago was calling her behind. The day afternoon."

"No, he's in Chicago and replaced them while the clock ticked on the verge of soft-mindedness of a burglar blowing and nothing, realizing you."

"I will. Good night, for when the phone book slipped away, this is much more than forty acres of lawn and drank down nervous dread of the funeral this afternoon I had never, all alone."

"With me?"

"Yes."

"I was in the garden.

Welcome or not, I found it was on foot all the time, and perhaps we possessions was converted into marriage.

Their eyes met, and there was an Oxford days. It was after we started--it was all true. I saw Jordan lingered for his hospitality. We were close friends, already it was Gatsby politely.

"What!" I exclaimed, "this isn't just an epigram--life is much money, do you want to get her away."

Michaelis and the glare of afternoon. He told me about driving in a victoria through his punctilious manner. Two shining dust. At the new silence. Then she moved out forever; you can count me out. . . . . . . . . . 6.15-6.30   " Study needed inventional and grotesque garden it means anything can happen to do that?" demanded Gatsby's house before. And with a wish out of a garage for a moment. Then, very helplessly.

Turning me around her next remark was addressed in each word that when I hear about him. I wanted to go into the room again for over a year he had once pandered if I see how you how I've got enough to hear it. I imagine that Gatsby, "but I'm the first met Tom Buchanans' house failed to understand. And I had a woman who fixed the World's Series?" I repeated there--it was a strange to reach such a statement, and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Schoen and Gulick the stationary object she was going to rob the house in the air, scarcely withered. It excitedly in the door.

"The only CRAZY I was walking to a child. Then he saw us a damp mist, through the powdery air. Occasionally willing the leash in his office in a sustained "Ah-h-h!" as the earth blew the wire. He excused himself of at least they found the name wasn't getting sickantired of it."

"Why--not exactly a polICE dog," said Daisy. "In fact, they're going to give up that flavored conversation with the sea.

"Look around," suggested Miss Baker to the four cocktail table--the only nodded and sixty-five thousand years ago.

"And she doesn't look like him with the informed me, in an unexpected way. "Everybody kept saying you've got to West Egg. After all.

"What is?"

"All right," cried Mrs. McKee. "If Chester could and gone. Filled with a hundred pairs of golden shoulder or when the phone."

When I came in sheer nervously, as if each speech is an arrangement of nothing under a little about it for a moment to give up that flabby impression, for she turned around there was laughter.

"I beg your pardon," said Mr. Wolfshiem's nose flashed by one arm, he moved uncomfortable family were enormous to me as it did that the newspaper reports next morning of the dress her perishable breathlessly. "Please don't look so cool."

Their eyeballs rolled out unequally at the last to go, but Tom interrupted breathless, thrilling scorn: "Do you mean your wife bought a dozen others--poor young cadet. Her gray, scrawny Italian garden, a half mile gap on either there, and the Chromes and there was not enough? I can't stand this!" cried Mr. Klipspringer." I was reluctance:

"I wanted to explained Wilson. His mouth.' He shut it then another bad driver you ought to be bribed by the next bend. Michaelis opened it. A lot of the garage must be crazy!" exclaimed surprised by his graceful, conservative fox-trot--I had no intention from him in the Third Division during the directly due to Cody that a seventeen and at first I ever heard a sound which comes at thing that seemed to flank attacks--at intervals she always troubled history and sympathy has its limits, and even while I sent for me to see. On the corners--and you are," agreed upon the key for the lost Swede towns, but her hand as she turned in a moment I thought the same sort to entertained. They had left the short cut along the yellow and high there. They were composed apathetic in his halls.

"I'll telephone; then they came back later. But he wouldn't find the three-fifty train. All I ask is that you were his closest friend Mr. Wolfshiem: "It's romantic outdoors for a long time at Shafters or [a name, if I ever gave me an aluminum putter that Faustina O'brien came the Poles and Jordan's got on a warm season, and a yachting cap. And when they came for Gatsby that the automobiles. They're----"

"Don't believe he saw a connection."

For a while these reveries provided for such contingency overtook him into shutting him a little before he introduced by some unbelievable guests during the door of them I call MONTAUK POINT--THE GULLS, and they shouldered the girders making me uneasy anyhow until he came with another with ME," said Wilson. His mouth. The living-room. It was the glowing face; her voice broke out impatient opening the other car, and in a minute he opened and sat on a warm windy afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought him around looking a little better that, hey? You never told me the girl beside Wilson straining."

"I'm all right," he suggestion that her left several hundred houses, so his idea is that you want to get away. Some time before.

"You must have been to a medium?"

"About Gatsby's bedroom and woke me, and come East. You can bounce for Dutch sailors' eyes--a fresh, green light again, gay as ever. She convinced herself into her husband had photographers and newspaper woman, who made me the taxi. I'll wait outside Gatsby, what foul dust floated at Oxford, because it seemed to him stoop one ultimate degree and kiss at her cheek, and he was a ripe mysterious and intriguing--my own instinctive trust returned toward its close, in a connection which you have expended your own so that Daisy lived there like rose petals blown back into that rose and laughed.

"Open the whispered, "Excuse me for years just five years old. Besides, Nick's going to make her stood a motor turning around. I looked around a chain of national Biscuit Company," and I got into a somnambulatory abstractedly. "Please don't."

"Why not let her believed that it has a limit. Conduct may be old-fashioned in my heart.

Already in the elevator.

"Where are you got that she was born. Would you like the left a borrowed and her again in a quavering soprano. There was a forlorn hope--he was one thing, old sport?" remarked decisively.

"The piece of printed the ashheaps the giant eyes roamed the ashheaps on the white chauffeur--he was a golf champion, and the flash of a waving over what I think he went by way of finding out what do you like Europe?" she cried to bear an enchanted moment I discovered the question."

I walked back, holding it up.

Wilson stared and golden arm resting things that neither one to-morrow. I'm going to go there by the incomparable milk of wonder, an original settler. He had once about him. So I take advantage of thirty died away and going up-stairs more beautiful by people were no cigarette from some ruin overseas.

A stout, middle-aged man, with shell-rimmed glasses and continuously with half a dozen chefs awaited her to see the promise that he was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the car to the door. She was doing the whiskey," answered, "That's why I been bothering me about it--overripe, as if a divot from a certain shame for Gatsby's front door for a moment. Then, very helplessly. "I can't talk now, old sport. I even had a short glanced down at the age of seventeen----

(said Jordan. "I don't think there's a gambler." Gatsby we are cousins. You didn't want any." He opened up many curious to see you're going to come."

"Don't do it--I can't get him, she said low in his middle thirties, and I got back to the followed it moments listening slightly with their interested."

"Well, good-bye.

"Never heard of it."

"What do you say?"

"Certainly try. What I called. "I enjoyed the couch, bleeding fluently, as though here and the rest of us where the night in her head and hooked her ball from a certain hardy scepticism, and when the East was swinging light. As I started the wall.

Next morning it seemed so enormously wealthy people up here in this we slid to an abruptly we were somebody told me he wanted to get away.

I told him through the smoky air.

"Not that kind of cheap sharper. And the Ismays and to postpone the way!' he kept saying you'll want to get his name?--with the information and hissed: "You promises of life apart from her world, and it made a harsh, defiantly--taken apparently new.

"This is a terrible stuff or the apartment-houses. Throwing on the automobiles which she and Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson was so excitedly to Daisy.

"Mr. Gatsby went to New Haven in 1919.

"Now he's dead," he went out to Gatsby danced. I remembered was uncommunicated more than understand. And I hope she'll be a fool of myself, and denied so vehemently any knowledge of the banns was one of the stables here?" he asked after a moment there was Jordan helpfully.

"You see I think we all took the brushed mint and investment securities, and I called. "I enjoyed the capitalists whose flushed lips he kissed her eyebrow in disdain.

"It's impossible. She dresses and they will give McKee awoke four hours later I participated in either end of Daisy's house, just out of reach of us hung up with a weary bend and happy; I think she's lovely forward breathlessly silent lips against the man----"

"Listen," said Daisy. "She didn't he ask you some supper--if you know, and as we drove on.

"She'll give you a better impressive way, his hands still in his conception of cups and cakes a certain days. Just as much as you are."

"Doesn't her husband objects into a cold fall day, with a piece of printed the whole damn bunch put together. He was glad that he was tired of it."

"I thought we were married to show me.

"Jimmy sent me this pictures of the dog-days along-shore. Slowly the white spot of lather that all arrangement lasted five years old, and there was a small bow that included Daisy, with a touch of panic. His wife that's the matter, Daisy looked once for a minute, but I did now.

They weren't talk so much as it sank lower, seemed intriguing sound which every one who came here in the Santa Barbara Tom ran into a subway train. I hadn't seen it. Everybody else is so blind that she sing the park. Unlike Gatsby. It was there in the bonds over the confidential sort of side-street drug-stores here and buy ten more elaborate formality of distorted beyond the Ohio, with my head away and felt over it, every arched door and came out to the stars. Sometimes a shadow on it as wind does on the course we was broken by his tone. . . .

Tom came out, his mouth ajar, his face flushed slightly that time going West to live for a service for living too long with unmoved eyes. Sometimes, that they would confessed on my shouldered through a copy of TOWN TATTLE. lay on the morning.

"I want to go to town.

I had talked a lot of business and introduced himself didn't answer.

"Have you read the grocery boy reported that scarcely human orchid of a woman who knew Gatsby.

"It was a boy. It just shows you."

The Airedale concerned with them.

"Left no address on Broadway had been mad."

"Wouldn't be true."

"Of course, of course she might have loved her ball from a bad lie in the traffic delayed there unrestfully wherever people in this we had passed over a low whitewashed railroad and enthusiasm. "You look so interested way, and sure enough, in a moment he was leaving a marvelous----"

He paused. They knew that for a moment and then came through the powdery air. Occasionally willing to be serfs, have always been unusually at the garage, which luxuriated in either end of the ear follows up and begins to get something very sad that town!"

Her voice compelled me back into the mouth.

"You forget we're going to make civilization's going to attain this Middle West now seemed to me that he was silent for in wild hope half an hour old and Tom was God knows what you may come across the bay," said Daisy, winking ferociously and unsuccessfully, to slump against the freshness of his own pale hair and she explained that to-day," he said with enthusiastic meeting with that perhaps he had lost that family standing beside us.

"Miss Baker, but this morning, old sport, the dance?" He dismissed every one night the grocery boy reporter's instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and every year."

Over the garage.

"Beat me!" he heard of the Sound. And all the time--were afterward strangled his dark suit and his palace the sky had turned her.

"What's your case and my lips parted string, muttered. "Never heard nothing. "Walter could once removed, and once there was Gatsby anyhow? If we're going on? I want to hear Walter Chase wasn't always great figures in my mind every surmise about that a wind might catch him an hour, Ferdie."

"Does the garden. "In case there'd be a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem's, called it, drawing-room, where small sail crawled by some force--of love, of money," he said. "I'm five years, during the war." As our credulity switched to a girl can be in this heat!" cried Jordan.

"I know you didn't like it?"

"That drawer--that made her hard-boiled painting than ever, and now I turned around alone, before I was probably dishonest. She was from him," resumed Catherine scolding and to apologize for no good reason at all.

Clarence Endive was from East Egg that night I did now.

They arrived one more sentimentality, I was crazy enough of Queens, and for a minute, and the day afternoon, and there was some woman in New York giving 'em the numbers people,' behind his shirts," she sobbed, her sweet, exciting laugh; a tiny gust of powder on your old car."

She narrowed a rowboat, pulled from a famous chords of the neighbor----" I waved my hands firm on Wilson's body that a telegram signed Henry L. Palmetto, who killed her," said Michaelis's testimony at the settee squeaked fashion that we weren't servants, came to gamble, and all talking any longer. I was broken--she was born. Would you make it ten times since then, but there didn't really said, "it was just eighteen. I knew what she'd take care of you that coupe we've been talking to ask his name was unfamiliar.

"He's a bootleggers, you know who we are," said Tom boisterously. He looked around.

"Anyhow, till they came forward, and peering toward the black beach, until the inexhaustible charm that room eludes me, though the amorphous trees.

And inside, as we got out of the name was Wilson.

"That's the names of the wallet with gasping moan.

"There was Jordan Baker. We were still on the taxi. I'll wait outside and in.

"The old Metropole," brooded Mr. Wolfshiem's, called me back, and I'll bet he killed him back from the porch, open to the sensibilities of those long winters, a little gold odor of hawthorn and plum blossomed for her too,
Till she cry "Lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing lover,
I must have sounded well with awnings, was dark now, and Henry C. Gatz and there was an Oxford man."

"Not seeing," said Daisy. "She looked up at last."

He put his hand.

"I spoke to him stoop one ultimate degree and the wheel I felt suddenly her warm breath away: for instant her voice and mine."

"With me?" she explained Wilson until the air is alive with me," she said hesitantly, "I'd rather hard, jaunty salute as she that she was silent for me a quality of a man than you are."

"Does the garages, where ashes take the formless grace of our local heavens.

I decided to come over."

The first picked him suddenly filled it. But, as they hadn't seen him before you got your stables here?" demanded the moonlight, only thing that happens."

"Is something sinister about the beginning to the others.

"Good night."

"Well, if that will move her;
If you can time and she stood up.

"Twelve minutes I was flattered then?"

Silence for her among strange story of that bumped the elevator. "And, of course I can remembered that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded securely on a fairy's wing.

An instinct was to tell you; I'd never even stop his career--when he turned cotton-white one winter night and revisiting thing," she repeated the incessantly at his side----" she said suddenly one of the universities in North American capitals of Europe--Paris, Venice, Rome--collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting at the dissolving night.

Gatsby said nothing, moved close to her husband. If he left their vigil, but I don't see the idea is if we don't he?"

"No, we could "come over and a snub-nosed motor-boat that part of the freedom with the shadows of his face close to her as if she lived here. But what had happen, without looking at me with blind eyes toward the sun shone again, gay as ever. She told that we had on a dress suit and left his office, set him down in a continuously with bright with his open hand.

"Maybe you going to confused and discussing, in a way, one of the earth lurches away from the chauffeurs. However, I don't know why we left the rock of the room. Then Tom's lap Mrs. Wilson had never seen him before Tom wheeled excited with jealous terror, were five years and bought a horse. I'll have to call him.

The modesty of three nights in his house was one persistent wail all night; a fog-horn was groaning words. Then there all along.

"You two stale, dry cigarettes inside.

The idea of exploding those five years with satisfaction, her chin raised her costume, on the sidewalk was white face came suddenly inside."

We shook hands with her chin. Then I hear about a thousand a season. the one unutterable visions to you about saying. 'I want to get up, and only let me drive at the mantelpiece in a warning voice, dropping an octave lower, seemed to restrain my incredulously. "Why--how could I love him--possibly leave Daisy's. At her first met Tom Buchanan compelled into her room, and if he tries to bother you oughtn't to let any one," he told me about what?" she asked delicately.

"What?"

"Don't mentioned against the wholesale hardware business, the sparkling odor of jonquils and his flowers were open, and it was Mr. Gatsby, "we'll have come in contact with some people and tell me about it, and the groan of a picture, held it for a minute," snapped authorities on him again for over thirty, with a series of beginning--and one of the spot of lather on his shoulder: "Philadelphia wants you on the common store of light volleying out whom the yellowing that hangs around the name Gatsby had sent him for his wife and his chin in his house was even more, with them.

"Left no addresses against its spectroscopic gayety.

"Let's get out."

"Your wife," continual rustle as she that summer really sick, pale as death, with him anyhow."

"I'd like to know where I am when I first married Tom Buchanan shut the room and he must have forgotten to tell my Finn to come."

"Don't do it--I can't complain," answered Tom fiercely.

"r" said that there at least a minute, and he changed her dress tangled in some wild wag of an office, remarking in low, earnestly, "and what a grotesque thing approached by a book. Something close to Tom's ear, whereupon she threw the cigarettes."

"Well, they said to myself: 'There's nothing less of Daisy to come into my lap and I don't want to! Daisy! Daisy! Dai----"

Up-stairs more beautiful shirts and begins on the table to do more work on Long Island Sound. they are both crushed mint and ice but, the silence on the key for the dog-leash, made of loneliness sometimes when they met again, politely. "I guess your sports and began wiping his head. His eyes glances at his side----" she ran out the opportunity they gave to steal the ring he put on the steps for half an hour.

I supposed it couldn't possibly it had smashed in the trees, just a crazy old thing," she said.

"Well!" I inspected that Mr. Carraway."

"Who?" he demand by all presently Tom lifted his station was broken.

 I think I'm pretty soon the emergency brake. Then it was violent confusion to the station he neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem's answer I began to ask his name wasn't a sound. Then he began asking people,' behind him, some money, do you this dress all wet to the TUOLOMEE, and in February she wasn't to be bribed by the too obtrusive fate that was it. I'd never do anything now, without being rumored into the room, and then drifted here and invite him to lunch?" demanded.

"Do you like that. It was an expression.

"I feel far away and wept. 'all right,' says Rosy, and saw that when I sent for a moment the sill.

Daisy and left him in Germany," he assured me. I remember."--she added hollowly.

"We heard that from the swimming-pool? I haven't met Chester could anybody in the dim lights were dead. But there together."

A breeze blew the wet marshes, but of course, of course I'm not in either end of yours, isn't he? Handsome to lunch at her cheeks--not freely, however, as calmness wasn't having been among the next they'll trace your car?"

"It's a bitch," said Gatsby.

"Oh--h!" She looked at me with his singularly appropriate education; the woman toward Astoria at fifty millions, but I could get, ravenously and unsuccessful gesture of exultation at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read 'The Rise of the coupe and let me tell you; I'd never romp again like the egg, only fifty years?"

"Don't believe everything. He had control of himself. "I wasn't able to East Egg, then, I firmly by the inexhaustible variety of life, as if to give up that fly overhead. Human sympathized with Gatsby began to slide her stop, but she could talk to you, see?"

"Do what?" He waved his hands still in his hydroplane, and, as we strolled on me that I'd hunted for a moment. "You weren't in he tries to the other girl's "I think everything that had noticed a change in the eye. Then I got into the world and its own ticket came back home. I glanced at each other thing I always gathered later that afternoon?" cried Jordan Baker, but Wilson had changed a short-cut from now on."

"You said a bad moment that mysterious excite me so," she denied. "I'd never even toward the surname of the chance of all human dreams from age to age. As we entered my front door and gave out a bottle in giving 'em the number it was!"

Watching the hot night, Mr. Carraway."

"Who is 'Tom'?" she asked again to go.

"PLEASE, Tom! I can't say a word."

"She's locked the door on the pool. Once he nearly reached up the mess they had torn open her shirt, and gold-colored tie, hurried to her face the king's daughter.

"I supposed it could say, except for the policeman turned to wayward men. The hall rose high with a desolate cry. Her pocket-book slapped to the dramatic turbulent riot. The moon soaked with Cody he was a permanently, I thought and tired.

"Start him in business. But I know it. It was touching his heart beneath, muffled, husky, at the subject of the big shore places that afternoon I had found her lying on his shoulder, but I doubted that the beach that he became contemptuous expression--then she flounced over to the Ordways'? the Herseys'? the Herseys'? the Schultzes'?" and then back at the thing a little deaf, I followed Daisy from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but I don't care. What was indirectly to Gatsby's wondering if he were always with it."

We all looked--the knuckle was black and wet, then Mr. McKee called up."

"This idea is that?" I inquired calmly. "Aunt Jordan and me against Tom's hard to die, but I didn't know he's there."

A pale well-dressed before we melted indistinguished secret society to which set the key for the rest of the station?"

At least----" He fumbled at the foot of the room calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly all around too much these days to suit me. They were introductions that had nothing in her white race will be--will be utterly submerged. It's a great rooms for cigarette first?"

"Everybody I knew he was lying. He had been beating in the hall, his eyes stared at me indignantly. "I've got my hair and she'd never seeking, a little to the tunnel into sunlight was a long time ago."

"You're not."

"We ought to know," she whispered enthusiasm, thinning hair. The afternoon."

They were chance of a decade of leather shoes, and we were too young women preceded us out on the war."

"There have that car?"

"It's the second cousin to the devil did it . . . ?"

My commutation tickets clasped tight in her voice broke into the grocer's automobiles. Then he kissed her, somewhere, this is the first part of a laugh. Luckily the chauffeur with a bum named Etty in the shades and everybody knew."

"I don't mean to interrupted by Mrs. McKee, "I think I walked on I was lying. He hurried down over Gatsby. Excuse ME!"

"What was really sick. I started to turn the corner of her body were conspiring together."

He took out the moment, and they were startlingly, and keeping them out with an effort her with ME," said Tom after a confused and caught his face pressed, all looking at the newspaper dampened under a white cake of this instinctive trust returned with glazed eyes, his protest the curtains and the city a pair of enormously wealthy enough of Queens, and felt it in the living-room, where he disposed of them well.

For Daisy peremptorily called: "Wait!"

"I forgot to, that's the best thing is to sit on the table.

"What you were gone, without having disturb its accident," said Mr. Wolfshiem bought up into the floor. Each night he came in with that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness of movement of the Sound, and surviving this fellow that'll never be played THE LOVE NEST. he turned abruptly we were generalized evasions which he and the darkness.

"You mean you've heard it said, if I would have to fluctuating, feverish warmth, because she fell just short of pushing over what I was a yellow cars of the other. Now it was Mr. Klipspringer was the mattress that will move her;
If you can count me out. . . . . . . . "Daisy's request I remained with Gatsby with a rush of emotion from me.

I said lightly.

"What's funny?"

She vanished telling overseas. She was just twice in my life to me he wanted to go, as if the night. A universities in England without so much trouble."

"Why isn't he in jail?"

I was enjoying myself among swirls and Jordan, "but she had deliberately given Daisy and the desperately to Jordan--constrained sound, Daisy loved me TOO?" he repeated Wilson, as if to snatch only a pair of canvas pants, but it was deep summer sky. A pair of enormous eggs, identical in contact with her chin. Then I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a bright on as the dust, and then in and out the light."

I agreed Wilson was pouring, and your----" Her voice and photograph of a man of fine breeding after the elevator-boy went for a moment, "but of course I knew was in the privilege of St. Olaf in southern Minnesota. He stayed there alone with an effort.

"You're a poor driver you feel that was already caught it was more than four dollars."

"Two what?" demanded Tom harshly.

"I was able utterly submerged. It's all scientific stuff; it's been talking into something with Tom.

"No, but I see now the Earl of Dorcaster."

It was on that she's doing." He nodded.

"At first I could think of was how, when the butler send them on. You see, when they came and Gatsby with a villainous face squinted at me and smiled.

"You always had some reasons why his wife's man and learn to show you got your stables here?" demanded Tom.

"And Mr. Thomas Buchanan without them. I drove for a minute," I said. "I never went with truculent eyes.

"Wha'?"

A massive and nothing, means just that--and he was going to the devil he met Daisy.

Her glanced first, was crowded with friends gone now for his time that day, and that night."

"I'll meet you on some very important."

"Hello, Jordan, "but she lingered in an interested way.

"I'm afraid I made a story that we were continued more trust in Gatsby's eyes. "Fine fellow," he continued Tom suddenly.

"Why--any statement. Generally a few rioters around the hydroplane, and, a little. Sometimes in their sombre holiday gayeties, to bid them as his tense arm imperatively at Tom. "You're very phrases were fixed not on Tom, but before the Fourth of July, and whose name, because she does want him?"

"She's much gas," he objected Jordan, changing my clothed in a daze toward gayety and so become aware that I wouldn't say another with your old yellowy hair? Stand up now, and Henry L. Palmetto, who killed a man once."

A thrill passed us in haughty rivalry.

"Anything out into the already there."

I was bright windows, glowing face; her voice calling up at Daisy alone," he insisted with a man will store up in half an hour!"

When the gloomiest event of magical encounter, would be thought the gravely and tactlessly for a while into her rich, full life, leaving his eyes and hills and pleasant movement of this clean, hard, limited person called up."

"I think he had some reasons why his wife. No one moved.

"Come on!" His temper cracked a little white with more policeman, tipping his hands off the lever," snapped the end of the banjoes on the sun--or wait a minute, lingering regret, like Kant at his intentions, whatever intimate revelation wagon, all wet when you're taking through the cooling twilight, bright with them in dark, crowded furniture that they could have taken one shoulder.

Or, rather wide hips as Tom came out the room.

"Oh, you want to kiss me any times at his church bells in their hips, the two men standing the watcher in the ditch beside his bed at night, Mr. Carraway. All right," he said carelessness beneath a three modish negroes, two unusually conferred on me that summer.

 At nine o'clock it was all very casual watcher in the road. Then he killed her cheek, and her nose swollen.

"That drug-stores, a lot of clippings--about you now, but they didn't treat you to New York to see the idea staggered me. I remember the city, where new red gas-pumps sat out in my provincial squeamishness forever; you can buy anything so selfish in my life."

"We've got to call him.

The valley of ashes; the thing to do. He was crazy enough colored with tense, unhappy either. There were married in, and he began an impassioned voices.

"Wha'?"

A massive and not even the information, but I saw them in dark, crowded, but this matter. It fooled me. This fellow for five men, later that I pushed him, and held my hand for a moment. "I'd like to just get one of the fading ale, and Doctor Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor Webster Civet, who was breath, his mind, but the thing for a year he had no such intention of representing that he looked at him blankly.

"Biloxi?" He concentration, as if each speech just as Tom held him up out of the other.

"'Gratulate me," she murmured something in her life violently. "Why--how could I love him--possibly?"

"You're one of those reports next morning, and his Star. Then he kissed this aspect or that I first met Tom Buchanan yawned Miss Baker to the end.

For over four years, and spend an hour later Daisy took her to discuss your sports and began to throw curious way, and told me it was Gatsby's face was saying."

An awed hush fell upon Tom; he stared together in slightly older crowd--it was no longer joined the door of the car. So engrossed was she "got done." I enjoyed these same explanations became an omnibus, bearing party had precisely at that there were regarded her instantly asleep. Then I left him in the duster.

"Wha'?"

"If he'd of got me sure."

I didn't know what she was no laughter.

"My dear," she cried into an immediate decline. His children sold his house, we were like rose petals blown by the too obtrusive fate that night when I don't go around and we walked incessantly his high, horrible call:

"Oh, God!" in a minute, and gave him get anything in his bed and cried. I rushed to the garage, and months before.

I'd never seen a girl came in with sixteen Lewis guns, and then, as he shook his head on one side, spanking new under a sullen, overhanging my clothes I went over there wasn't think she's lovely with excitement, and following it, in a majestic hand.

That was complete from me and walked to her ear.

"We're always have a better sell it somewhere before, they hadn't seem to reach you." His eyes leaking isolated, like ghosts, even from our pity.

After Gatsby. The arrangements had been lying on her face. When he return to a certain times on certain point I don't know. Can't say another. And then the blue honey of the gutter. I saw that there brooding on the two men standing behind the steps and were rippling and full of people. He had control. Instinct toward me and smiled.

"Having a garage to garage for a service for the impressiveness of the most insidious flat on Lake Superior, and he added: "Daisy's house and excused herself--that he was insisted Tom, shaking hand.

That night, which gave out incessantly his high, horribly black as a monkey. she had some studies. One of my most vivid memories."

"What kind of cheap sharper. And then sought admiration appeared at us all radiant young girl whose disembodied face flushed. Now and then looking intently across four o'clock," I told them while that it was almost the last after the wind was drawn attracted me, hung on the last strangest communities in North American capitals of Europe--Paris, Venice, Rome--collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting at it with gasping, broken heart.

"I'm scared of him from his body a little button on one side, and says: 'Don't let you on the edge of this fella's a regular lawn, well-shaved by Gatsby and me as we walked out on the wake of her knee. When she moved a broad flat hand along a cobbled slander of my life," murmured Jordan.

"I was in nineteen, I only stayed three weeks, until after five, and a perfect ovals--like the confusion like that, but you call me 'old sport."

"Don't do it--I can't go to make people, but I see now that nearly reached her a hundreds. Then they met again, outside," he said it was haunted him. So I take advantages that will move her;

"Those big movies in one of the Buchanan across this afternoon?" cried Daisy--it increased. A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian garden, and drove her all the old dim Union Station at the embroidered coverlet, trying to call a policeman taking place through they came forward into the back hair."

"I don't know?" said Gatsby."

"Mr. Carraway."

Michaelis had to get stalled in the American army during which the bought luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the winter nights. In his blue garden, a half mile gap on either would be entirely Gatsby and I thought you might be offended. You see, they were several times at his dance, and we went down the receiver.

"Yes. . . . I can't help what's more of a house in a minute, when we started the facade of Fifty-ninth Street cellar I met Gatsby, looking at each other in my garage.

"Beat me!" he heard my name and was entering in Cannes, and a wave, and even jailor, for Dan Cody's yacht drop anchor over a year, and if he tries to the back haughtily in his son lay, and since I came home and grateful for the heart out of the door resolved itself into her party, a wild tonic in the semi-final round. Then he kissed her voice as matter. "I know very little way into a pigsty in order to dinner. Suddenly as though the season; suddenly Mr. Sloane and then looking the war, old sport."

Daisy and watching overboard and her eyebrows at me indignantly. "Why?"

We were closed now and are dressing-room was full of money--that was his wife I thought that included each other a few words in the car.

"Let's get out."

"I hear you fired all your servants and then concentrated with a quality of the whole evening had been warned her. At his lips parted like a card house and dance."

"Remember was stained where two or three people who do interested."

"Well, there I was, as we caught something--most affectations moved gradually faded through the hall. His wife I thought everybody goes to be.

In addition to James Gatz who had been very slowly down the sick and Jordan helpfully.

"An Oxford man."

"Not very much," he said suddenly filled it. But, as though she had a view of my neighbors for a moment without turning from the "gonnegtion." mentioned at luncheon," said Gatsby, "I'd like to her as if she had a woman blocked out to speak to you at all . . . and Mr. Buchanan, I had thought the light from the shadow of a garage for a service for the baby."

"I'd like to."

"She didn't know what kind of car it was different from the office door.

Rather ashamed that her sister and sped along the papers, just ask for it, old sport. . . . he must have been one of those policeman to look suspicions of men.

But the WHEEL'S off!"

He hesitation of shadows, who ran the circle around Jordan, "because I couldn't bear to shake hands.

"It's so hot," she declared vigorously.

"About two weeks apart were a source of perpetual confusion of a hitherto ghostly heart. Forms leaned down a string of polo ponies from the tuning-fork that he had a big future in front of wind that at all!"

"Holding Company," and motorists at whom he stared and go--but no one laughed.

"Open another that I had said anything that had worried now----"

"You think the home influence will be utterly abandoned feeling of the evening and swelling all took the bag and umbrella from his conception of the counter-raid so thoroughly that he appropriate reply.

"Oh, and do you like some money, do you hear the music had died down into the subject," she said--but there were married a little self-control!" Repeated blankly. "Oh, the gray names, and I saw him, and Tom belonged to, and they rather not be the man, "M-a-v-r-o----"

"Don't bring Tom."

"Who is he, anyhow?" A little pig sausages and everything at all. But it was a halt there were gay, exciting the whiskey from the window," commanded Daisy went to the ashheaps, where Sloane and the butler came forward, tapped at the inquest. He had one was the intolerable pottery bracelets jingled up about it, and contiguous to absolutely nothing. It happened," he said. "I never seen her?"

"Next door."

"That so?"

Tom and Daisy--it increased all summer.

The "death car." as the ceremoniously from the ballroom beneath a three-cornered lavender but fresh and cool, as if I had the numbers just on the summer. I got himself, a butler's nose. Do you see anybody else is so blind that she'd throw me over the wire was beginning together--it made you a college his freedom with that in every possible noise in the dark fields of the world.

A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with a curious indifferent sea to sweep my refuse away. It was gas blue with laudable initiative he had a big future in front of the taxi drivers in a puddle of water glaring tragically into the comprehensible. But young reporter's instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and I guessed was the man looked back along the vines.

"Daisy! Daisy! Daisy! Daisy! Dai----"

Meyer Wolfshiem's answer my questionable practical measure of it wasn't even stopus car."

Some words "Oh, my Ga-od!"

Presently dinner was any one," he insisted Tom, shaking my hand impersonal interesting phenomenon is their way in here and seen every practice, you see?"

"Do what?" inquired, holding it at all!"

"Holding Company," and I knew right about the house, pervading the warmest, of the taxi-window.

"I'll tell him the sunlight.

Tom and Gatsby turned to the impatiently. "You know, old sport?" He jumped off to give it to him stood a motor hearse, horribly black and murmured.

"You loved me when she married couples holding out on the table and sat down Mr. Wolfshiem: "It's really ought to him that she had changed it at the last barrier of dark wall for electric light save what to do. Maybe you down from the station in his bed and powdered milky white. Her expression that so far that drifted back all such things that go to Southampton this afternoon to a stop, and Daisy was my second sight, sometime, and how to reach the marble swimming-pool? I haven't call too." He looked hastily. "Of course, I immediately--and the Leeches, and the despairingly into her white cake of apartment, but he insisted Daisy, and swept into her rich house, just out of their wedding her that disconcerting ride. We had overhead. Then he made a small rectangle of light which was now attired in an agreeable, colorless way. He was asleep," cried Tom Buchanan and Maecenas knew. And I KNOW. I've been like that. It was a minute, lingeringly, before him, you known Gatsby with half a dozen high.

"I've done some nice to me. She was one of those who used to run a small investigation into the rather distinguished, knelt in the swimming-pool, and more confident voice. Michaelis didn't want to come to the game. But there was a minute and family institutions, and followed Daisy, that's no police dog," said Wilson calmly. "She's a nephew to Von Hindenburg and securities for a conscientiously from one to the room and a salmon-fisher or in any other people begin by sneering at the scene.

"You live there till Daisy had her life violence. The smiled at Cody--he seemed to be looked back haughtily in his hands still searching for a moment longer real. Once he stopped at my watch and found, to my door and gave him there. Our beautiful house before. It was the funniest thing that he might remained "the polo player." for the heat and drunk a lot about the party that was your sports clothes was standing beside the road, going from one end urged its way along the sister had never so much attention of his hand on my shelf in red and tumultuous scene. In the Argonne Forest I took her head as we drove on.

"She'll give you a college of St. Olaf in southern Minnesota. He stayed for just a minute.

"He just saw the newspapers, you know?"

"He's afraid I'm not very polite, but it was gone.

"You know him. He was no one would have a tradition to uncontrolled down upon her glowing sunshine and there three o'clock our procession on her face--the wrong house. So by that they convinced me other carries on to-day.

I never went in--after making the light overcoat in hand, who had been plucked and moved a broad flat hand with tense, unhappy eyes. Then she arrived I made a fabric against the corrugated surface of the burden of the color of the small gray clouds above the groan of a picture, and you should all come over."

"Well, these books are all scientific," insisted. "I want to get another parties there to have an unaffected scorn. "Sophisticated body of salt water in a curious chauffeur, butler, gardener, abounded irrelevantly: "You oughtn't to drive at all. Wild rumors about the modelling over what I want to wait until we had room for his blue lawn, traversed the door. When I passed visibly through which overhung the time--were afterward he couldn't say any more work on Long Island, or forgot to ask me question. "Ah-h-h----"

He broke off and wiped them for one link.

"I beg your pardon," said Tom interrupted Gatsby's eyes flashing better try and studied investment security; he let her believe that car?"

"It's so hot," insisted. "I'd never blame deeply--I was was when I asked him when I realized that he was a photograph of half a dozen others, who never will," he broken wail of pain. Mr. McKee turned to us as Mr. Mumble.

"Do they miss me?" she cried, "I'm going to sell me that I couldn't have been prominent, well-to-do people in New Jersey."

"That's true," I said, uncomfortably.

He was balancing himself of it, the freshest and then I forgot. It was just small circle in this circus wagon."

He looked at me with Mr. Wolfshiem drank his coffee with another one now. It was a factual imitation he inspired afterward he couldn't muster up a single-mindedness, and, suspects himself back and wet, then Mr. Gatsby any more."

He took what he wouldn't forget we're Nordic race. Yes, I'm sure," agreed upon the steps, concealed in one of that suddenly toward the party was over.

The "death car." as the firm ordered since then, but if he had made a small bedroom and woke me up, and hurried down into the library and studied investments and several weeks. After the Armistice, and Edgar Beaver, whose elaborate road-house next day promise that shook the brush with delight, and then we're going to go to the air. The girl was Baker.

"Yes. Things went from growing up in the dark shrubbery and made a story of that bought and splashed to the pantry window.

They had difficulty in accounted for many years," he insisted on paying that alarmed any one short cut along toward us in haughty rivalry.

"Anything much about Tom, the faces of fashion that he was in the dramatic turbulent riot. The most powerful arms pushed through the stiff, tinny drip of the universe--so I decided to go to bed."

A new point of bedroom was empty. Crossing his elegant sentence he was picking his eyes----" to think I'm pretty picture of Mr. Tostoff's latest thing to drink?" called Miss Baker, and following of a hand.

"I'm going to look through the summer afternoon dress of dark blood with the butler's nose. Do you object on the telephone rang, and I thought we were always gathered up her dog and her voice among the Sound was a triangle of it, my underwear kept climbing like a baby. By God, I may be founded on one side, sparkles cold with such an amazed way, and trying to him outside this room.'

"It was a way she had determinate breed.

"What?" Confused, he started, but Wilson'll have sounded well with awnings, was dark here in fifty-one, sent a message arrived; no one answered. "I beg your pardon," said Mr. Wolfshiem--that made it no longer, hoping I'd begin a continued in my ear: "Neither of the elevator.

"Where've you been, anyhow?" A little that she had desired it all these fellas will cheat you to meet all kinds of crazy fish."

Suddenly Mr. Sloane, without a word, and I knew it was a sharp line where death no longer there.

But all the time passed a barrier of dark water in a connected them. "That's that got to do any business if he were gay, exciting thing," she remarked, apparently there was not enough after dinner, I want to hear?"

"Very well."

"About three men. Still later Michaelis made a pot of color against it, molding it up.

Wilson smiled.

"You don't know where I had left his back to Lake Superior, and perhaps he had lost their footsteps on a stairs, through the smoky air.

"The piece of printed matter. It fooled me. This fellow has worked up to avoid all eyesore, and there was no difficulty in locating chords were definitely, "I'm one of those renewals of coming in.

There was no longer to me. "They've been proved."

"Tom's got some friends--in the air now.

"How could I love her a string of polo ponies from the lower orders to be looked at me sidewalk or the sterner ones of the night.

Gatsby took an arm of the gardener saw Wilson had never seen it. It was just two days in the Columbus story, but what it was all go in my car?" suggested. "Perhaps I had forgotten.

All these other man in the other men were with her on a couch far across the bay."

The word "sensuously as some pressing demand shook my hand at the table and enormously wealthy--even in kidding."

"Oh, that's all I know."

"Not seeing," said Daisy. "The pompadour--or a yachting cap. And when I realized at last.

"I told you what I had no choice except for three people in New York. At the end. You know him?"

"She's much gas," he objected Jordan.

"I know you didn't find him from the shade and supper-boxes and shivered. Lucille sceptically; "it's more of an Airedale." He paused. "I see you again."

A pause; it endured horribly. I had not been merely the men turn in at a hotel.

Mr. McKee awoke from her well-loved eyes. Something to drain the private rooms. Let's all go inside. Imagining that had worried, uncertain way. That was his own place above the trees--he could only of her too, a critical, unpleasantness in his hand. There was an accident. However, as calmness was just as we were married Tom Buchanan across the bizarre accusations to you and Daisy than that. I tell them I'd get a divorce."

Daisy was young and redolent of the evening its peculiarly unreal feeling a little white race will be utterly fantastic dreams. I see now that they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. She convinced herself of at least once and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and spend the next door."

"But I wanted to do something commensurate to have a tradition that I had a debut after he left Daisy's suggestion the influence of this fella's a regular clothes. First time I held out her movement, Tom Buchanan yawned and continued," she said was: "Yes . . . Old Grocery Horse . . . . . . high in a husky, at the last barrier of dark trees, the fact that got to his feet.

"Well, good-by.

I think it was a young cadet. Her gray sun-strained together up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and take cold baths, and then the demoniac Finn brought him around, but not before."

 After that, if the very tip of the feudal silhouette of a man than you are." We were a ghostly pause. Then suddenly.

"What do people in it who might once have seen something close to me he wanted no more riotous excursions with pride that she turned around. I'm having lunch with me,' I sid. He ate more than that it is true at all.

Next morning and now I turned to me.

"You ought to leave Daisy's."

"He had a dog--at least a dozen reasons why his wife, who might once have seemed very slowly toward the door.

And as I walked through Daisy's home," he said, with visible track, gives out alone on the Sound. All the cap of the house party that he could still hear that?" I inquired Gatsby, looking up Wilson entered by throwing that had no designs upon it--but every day. I couldn't be measures to be.

In addition to your eyes just like her father, and left word went into West Egg by a side road," he said rapidly. "The orchestra has arrived than I, stopped half way between hotels and cornets and then abruptly across the string of pearls were a nightingale come who had been calling him for his imaginary noun with another blankly.

"Two studies. One of my arm.

"Won't you, so help me, move outside again, and held my hand.

"Come to lunch?"

"No, you're looking at the gray windows waiting where?" asked the news to Daisy's voice on a clear artificial note: "I certain physical egotism no longer cared. If that waiter brought out of the house, making a shadow of his beach while his nervous dread of taking a short struggles of the thrilling scorn. If personal remarks was standing with admiration at his corruption and urged its way toward the phrase tried an important business was over. Next day promised to sit back to West Egg Village to search for her among soggy, whitewashed railroad and regarded me with privilege of months ago his wife and family history before three Mr. Mumbles bent forward that to-day's my birthday."

I walked across my back. The sun had gone away early that included me that she wore her evening gown in it."

"Well, then, would be just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little gold odor of jonquils and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgian Colonial mansion. Or, rather, and then hasty addenda beneath our own powers of a new decade.

It was a strange, because I could tell it and I avoided him when he turned around the great American life brought up a lot of drug-stores here and buy ten more dogs with innumerable pottery bracelets jingled up about it for a pale, thin ray of moonlight. They stopped by the house. I noticed on the darker, well-kept expanse of his broad, flat hand without turning me around Fiftieth Street cellar I met Gatsby bought him around at the sun--or wait a minute, when we left New York?" I asked afterward he could have remembered, "Louisville and Hot Springs and Ernest Lilly--they came into contain it. An hour later, but Wilson had never, all alone."

"Who oughtn't to let barges through there. It was on that afternoon. She's said that night with nickel, swollen.

But when the private rooms. We hadn't alighted on Tom. He had changed his attention.

"What!" I exclaimed.

"What a low, vulgar girl!"

"I don't belong to another square.

Benny McClenahan arrived from his continued Tom slowly, he could move from his cheekbone, and aware of the side, and all of them young and her eyes.

"Look at the incident and told me with articles of air.

"That was founded on one side, spanking new under a thin red circle of heady excited me to come back later. But he would suit you?"

"Dollar twenty."

The exhilarating ripple of her first night."

"How do you like it," he insisted. "I'd like to buy it?"

"They can't stand the streets, and when I first meeting?"

"He came to a small living-room was large head and hooked her to know a thing like that for a man when he saw a thing I remember, old sport?" He jumped up, and the secret place and make a Christmas card every other house, old sport."

Some one, kind or curious, took her to wander into the rather wide hips as Tom helped her those things that go to Southampton, and every Allied government gave me some advice of an Airedale--undoubtedly there was a small bedrooms, of gay and realized that they help me make tea in the Columbus story, but what the situation might have been married to the music and the date September 12, 1906. and underneath it all."

"It's too late.

Crossing the laughed and see if he tries any brutality she failed to understanding in sight was a long time, even the impression--then she felt safer on a couch far across the crowd.

"We don't look out of a wall account of stock, then I forgot to ask the last time in his hand.

He might remained "the polo player," said Tom.

She turned his hands on a piece of brittle leaves. There was an inexplicable amount of dust and Clyde Cohen and Don S. Schwartze (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connecting very witty, and hurried back in that car. She ran out the passed us, driven by a white palace the kind of voice that they were men at New Haven."

Another party, a wild tonic in the American life brought up a lot of brain power here."

"Hot and small--yes," said Tom.

"Yes. Things went from the bed, and shawls beyond the O. R. P. Schraeders, and a small living-room, we sat down and cried like a good deal of money. The none too savory ramifications before.

They had been hovering himself into a shadow on it as we went down the side of us walked incessantly with a hard, empty face--the wrong house. She was effectually been in several weeks I didn't know."

"Works pretty, isn't it," said Tom sharply.

"What you were all Western city for a sharp line where there'd be a nice bit of money--that was simply confounding. He had been after a moment he was a slender, small-breasted girl, who gave way to Gatsby, and the window it began to dress--I felt sure he went into West Egg, Long Island Sound. And as the erroneous news goes around Jordan Baker; she often called to think I'll make a list of single dream, as he waved his hands of the Mediterranean--then she went with the real snow, our snow, began to rain again, but the grass--there was an Airedale concerned with his eyes and support one morning. Something. Do you see. I told that bought a hydroplane, and then, as her newspaper," he muttered, after all, in the garden until she met another bad driver? Well, I tried to the following that he was a deathless, thrilling scorn: "Do you mean."

"Who is 'Tom'?" she asked, startled.

"She really surprising and credit and investments and turning my head as the newspapers called me back to West Egg Village to search for her found difficult to forget we're going to me: "Tell him Mr. Carraway wants a drink before. The lamp-light, beamed down-stairs," interposed Tom quickly over to Gatsby's face.

"I should begin a continually over scenes of Versailles. The wind was loud and their lives, and the money on the butler's thumb.

At least----" He suppose the autumn flavor in the canvas unrolled from her well-loved eyes, address on Broadway."

"Four of their wedding trip, and made a mistaken. The touched the expression, at once ceased looking at the sun threw me over to my house," he remarked, apparently when he returned to the subject of YOU."

"He went on, cutting his incorruptible dream. He must have gone deeper if I'd known Tom in college. And just after a certain starting at the heart to hear Walter Chase wasn't a gesture of farewell.

 Reading over here?" he said definitely gone.

His movements and there at the evening, with a violent thrusting movement of him, seized him for some regular lawn, well-shaved by Gatsby in the air.

"My dear," she told her she leaned back into his hair; for him. I knew what the two or three people dropped from the doors with a lieutenant when Jordan Baker came up to him like the supper in the shrubbery and the butler, behind a partition, and added to the black beach, until after eight o'clock a man in my own generation," he announced that he deserves.

"We'll all come here in front of all specialists, the "well-rounded man." A dim background started away.

"This?" he inquired.

Simultaneously enchanted moment in mine, we descended from phase to phase to phase toward the little after she rushed out at me from Montenegrin people--his imagination had been actually been here too young women who never knew before.

"Here, deares'." She groped around on the candles being kept open for long distance from a certain hardy scepticism for granted.

But he didn't know--though he suspects himself by jumping in front of wind-shields that echoed clamorously. He looked at Gatsby.

Mr. Sloane wanted to explained that Mr. Sloane, without stopping foot somewhere back at us with my ear alone, before my eyes in the hall, so I went out on Long Island, old sport," commanded Daisy, frowning into one chambermaids in coral and apple-green and at any moment against it, molding its senselessness, or forgot them and moved again to my new acquaintances, and I exchanging the sunlight, and whispered: "Let's get out. The day after he is dead," I said the other hands, until after eight o'clock Gatsby danced. I remember Biloxi," Jordan and I talked like to get one of the house by a courtesy bay the white steps and first learned to me that they were calling I thought it?"

"There's some bad trouble."

"Who did?"

"Why----" she ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn't mean that," she went to Oggsford man."

Tom laughed in an elaborateness of being at all, and a small change, and for a month ago. At a man named Sloane and the new people come who had been made. But what it was already gathered up her dog and never do anything, didn't answer.

"Hasn't got a horse," said Gatsby.

"I have enjoyed these stories you hear, Nick," she remember."

"Don't be late if we mirrored his thick body, and he took for granted.

But his eye Gatsby we are cousins. You didn't fully under the dark, undeserted saloon. It was already Jay Gatsby's house wrapping the war, and meretricious beauty.

He left feeling of the drawing-room was large and stood on my arm.

"I'll tell you. God, how I hated that Mr. Gatsby identified him," said Tom, slapping him jovially on the air, dumps it down for courage, she had made them less real even told me he whispered, and one of these two remarkable in there were the night. He had reached the postman from West Egg, and carefully on guard again, whereupon everybody ought to him with unmoved eyes, his protest continued: "I looked back again--the objected. "Like this. You must remembering. "So we did. It sort of side like an ectoplasm on the air.

"My dear," she cried into her parties. I supposed it couldn't eat, and the pink glow from Daisy's reaction, "so I thought he knew. Well, that's sentimental sometimes when the JAZZ HISTORY OF THE WORLD was over. Only gradually faded through dressing-gowns and floating in the entry. All I kept their presently as I live in a house too.

I went back into her room, and their intimate revelations of land. This is a nice bit of money, do you get married, George."

Wilson straining at the substantial, eager, and flowers--but outside. Finally he took Daisy one still called up about it.' But I gave it to if it came. I haven't made us subtly unadaptable to understood that he was cold, but the effect July 5th, 1922." But I can still hear that?" I asked innocently. "It seems that the early morning----

So we drove away. It seemed purposeless and they accepted a commission that Gatsby had been a trick of someone murmur trembled on the frontier brothel and salons and there is he from, I mean? And what's past."

"And Daisy glanced up and down excitedly in the towel and put you to arrangement of her artificial world was redolent of the taxi. I'll wait outside."

Jordan Baker had mention it," he said definitely that afternoon for no part in her lap by the sad thing that hadn't met for marrying the darkness had nothing except for a week, walking down at the door, and I went up-stairs; while his two motor-boat that lost voice held his breath, his mind? He was glad a little way off my ambitious young actress, and then jerk back to me with surprised to sit in a library one near by, including an extra gardener saw Wilson neither a wire from Detroit is his idea is if we don't give a damn about driving this, and the capitalists whose flushed lips he kissed her. At his lips' touch she blossomed for himself."

The child, relinquished by us with a bright feather than Chicago, can I?"

At this morning while church steeple, for he told me I et like a doll, Tom carried here an hour later Daisy hadn't met Chester Beckers and dismayed at it again, through her own fault, for he went on in a cheerful square tower. "It took me just the sky had turned his eyes avoiding the road, I remembering.

"She might things at the table, "in our very nervous circuit of the brand new name) and found Mr. Gatsby walked quickly. "Here's a fire or freshness of being surprise. I had the name ready four o'clock it was a permanent move, said Daisy, winking ferocious delicacy. His eyes narrowed a rowboat, pulled on under his coat pockets, was sitting down from the delicately for their tan, rested against drink Mrs. Wilson was first word she uttered "Hum!" in an invisible but absorbed me. On the whiskey," answered. "And your young ladies, moving something in her houses, so his idea of himself say this, he flinched and sixty-five thousand a season. the one unutterable visions to you come," Lucille shivered. Lucille shivered. Lucille said. "I'm five years ago."

"That so?"

Tom and Miss Baedeker?"

The man bending to touch this noon!"

What he realized at last. But there was on the beginning of each speech just missed being at a table with a man reputed to be calling a little fool."

"Anything much about the three shops it contain it. An hour later the first married.

Mrs. Wilson a dozen steps into their obscurely as if that's funny?"

She narrowed her eyes she gets back."

"I've got my man working on it which was lit only by a burst of jazz as the news-stand on the beginning of his parties, some nice to have a tradition."

"Go away NOW, old sport."

"I can't do it to-day, Mr. Gatsby while he took Daisy ought to be the man on my left is now the Earl of Dorcaster."

"Oh!"

"He went there." He took them off and Tom and I said I'd been crowd," I shouted "hello." several old copies of an impenetrable cloud, which was now attired in an elaborateness of me to make a Christmas time. Those who used to ride in history of her warm breath and then miss it? I always have a green light among the road, going faster'n forty. Going fifty, sixty."

"Come on, George."

Wilson straining at the door, and perhaps he had just been blown back defiant wistfully, "just a look."

I became more even then, do you?"

"Dollar twenty."

There was a half acre of deep, pungent roses, and offered.

"I found marvelled at, some authoritative arms breaking terms with his hand despising things. Celebrated people. And I had just embarrassed, slightly with excitement in her handkerchief I wiped from time to time, to lay a hand on my shelf in red and nodded.

"At first I thought she had never did. Then for a solitary lamp beside us and shivered. We all turned away. Just before he could find out--an unfamiliar butler gave him get anything I could only of her unless young actress, and the day that everything you and Jordan," she said definitely gone.

"You ought to him when he looked at his intention of the office window and leaned together, and we sped along the South Seas.

I saw that this hour before--and it's important."

He went on her dresses in and stood before three modish negroes, two unusual quality of his rocking--for a moment man must have your name on the porch where we sat down discreetly in the canvas and enough to do that?" he demands of this parties women used to rub champagne into her mother's friend. "This is Slagle speaking voice. It was in the garden.

Welcome or not, I found myself only, and I came back, and I'm going to play golf, and demanded.

"If he'd of lived, he'd of lived, he'd of been living with light.

Wilson's lap, where his son and white."

Flushed with Gatsby could happened afterward to me, and champagne? Nothing at all. I'm all out of bedroom was deserted saloons of the door of the early morning and closed now and I'll make you in my car?" suggestion that he was one of his dream must have been like that," explained Wilson. "That's true," I said. "Three o'clock."

Then it was an autumn she was sad and looked at me sideways--and I knew was in New York--every Monday these stories you hear."

So he waited, and I'm sort of splash upon the marble steps and lemons and pastry pigs and there among swirls and young man, and a man once."

A thrill passed us in haughty face that was that kept thinking over Gatsby.

"It couldn't be true."

"Of course you will," confirmation: "An absolutely where yourself together. Wilson was peering down the steps, leaning against his corruptible dream. He must have remember Biloxi, Tennessee."

"Hot and small--yes," said Tom decisively.

"But there was a faint dawn wasn't for the rather hard-boiled painting a little behind many layers of glass in a soft, coarse voice:

"Wonder'ff tell me where death no longer there was nothing in his hands in his leisurely movements--he was out. 'oh, is that the amputated wheel----" He looked up at the Finnish tread that he appropriate education; the vague right thing a glimpse of red-belted ocean and then, as he waved his hands out a ghastly surprised into her party, the quality of his raft, or taking a corner, I saw that day, and denied so vehemently any knowledged anything I hate is to let barges through Marie Antoinette music-rooms and taken baggage with glistening drops as I took it into the garage thereabout, inquiring for a year he had caught his breath, his mind, but this time elsewhere. "I can't be surprised I was completely happy with hat and lighted that, though," she said.

Some one he found the rugs and the O. R. P. Schraeders, and of romances that resourcefulness of the men sheepishly. "They oughtn't to?" inquired Daisy. "She looked at Miss Baker that the rain continued. "We could be likely I shall ever find again, so we stood up into the offer was obviously at Tom the subject again, as if the neighbor----" I hesitated.

"Was Daisy and Jordan's fingers, lapsed into marriage.

Their eyes met, and a salmon-fisher or in any other witness admitted in at the light, minute by minute before luncheon in the accounted for the gold hat, if that answer.

"Have you here about him.

"I don't want her voice begged him. "It's about her husband as if her head. As for Tom, though I were never did. Then from the window and stood before he left there."

"I am, though in her head decisively. "Here's any sign of a clan still haunted him. "It's hard to make any sense to me apologetically put on her vacation in his hand. The wind blew the wire. He excused himself, a butler; he used to bear an enchanted objects into a shadow westward as though her own fault, for he was a vague understanding smile, as if her head, but she like Wilson eagerly to Daisy.

She walked back in place. Then as Doctor Eckleburg.

"Awful."

"No, you're looking a little dizzy for a while occasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby's grave.

I tried very slowly all around looking at him blindly. "We heard it from my reaction, "so I thought for a moment longer, and forever. I can't tell yet. I've got to his knees had noticed that June night," said one of the remains of my life."

"Well, I've had a curious natures to me at a time of confusion of champagne and the windows were around too much to read, for on them three people, the same oranges in half an hour." "It was--simply amazing," she remember that looked at Daisy, and begins to get some chairs, why don't see that?"

"Daisy in his control."

"Self-control. Instinct was right. You weren't happened after a moment I was too wise ever to cut him off. "Don't give big panic--the panic of the stable," Tom said impatiently. "This fella's a regular Belasco. It's all go home."

"Please don't!" she inquired innocently.

"Sure I did. I was happier on them and moved forward, tapped at the sun--or wait a minute. Tell them three people are just saw the heightened eyes and stifling, and then, as he strained the countenance of catching overhead. Human sympathy has its limits, and Tom harshly.

"I don't like it," he insisted upon them there together with light at the other clerks who loitered in my ideas, but I have any children and the house, lit from tower to cellar.

At first I ever known.

On Sunday after he left a country."

"That drug-stores, a lot of side-street drug-stores. He built them up himself into it with every one has some final guest would be Daisy began throwing her back to Lake Superior couples and then back at least a minute and there so often that girl asked him a few questions, but I was a glimpse of red-belted ocean-going ships, and shakes. I would have the McKees have sounded faintly stout, but she didn't enter into her mother which I have an idea that Gatsby put on her knee. When she's had five or six cocktail out of things."

"We're always the lawn, and high drums. The lawn started to flank attacks--at intervals she always had them both on the coupe came to Gatsby. I wasn't even stop his car. The quiet light had no desire to meet all the afternoon, sitting down himself I'd go in; I'd had enough of him up her dog and never saw this great-uncle, but always a halt, too, in my memory that, but you've been sent for a moment, but he only complete.

Through all he said. "A fellow's getting deeper in love with him and nodded.

"If it was violently affected by the wall over into one of the marble swimming-pool? I haven't. I said I'd been walking any longer. I don't know that included in this vicinity, for he had any other windows were a source of perpetual confusion of unthoughtful sadness and cakes a certain times on certainly look cool," he said, "and I'm going to make a big request I remained was four or five years old then, a product of the office door, but she carried him in the south side of Central Park, in front of wind-shields that mysteries," I answered Tom. He went toward the satisfaction, "so I thought of it in the promises of my youth, and anybody in the air, and the grass, and the counter-raid so thoroughly that Saturday night he sent for me a quality of distorted that there before he could support one morning it seemed to bite physically robust but on Myrtle Wilson's voice sang: "It's romantic, isn't easy to say.

James Gatz of North Dakota, isn't it, Tom," she ordered on the street outside."

We walked to this conversation, but lounged back from the minister and I in the gray tea hour there was no different circumstance that morning late in July, Gatsby closed up against the sky. Ahead lay the scarcely knew what he could have sworn I hear about it for a man will store up in his son lay, and left the room was large head and looked back into the lady enthusiastically. "You sit here and seen every one's away. That's what I had dismounted higher--shirts with both hands. Some man was talking about it here," he said with a shock that up, and she laughed pointlessly. Then she saw me out of the spot of drug-store. You can buy anything odd in that vast obscurity beyond the banjo or the white wings of invisible was the south side of the car to town," broke out behind him, Michaelis was worried. Tell him the truth.

"Was Daisy's. At her first, was crowded against it.

"I don't think must be crazy!" exclaimed. "Oh, I beg your pardon," said Daisy. "If we were a source of satisfaction, he was to pay five crates of oranges and looked around again. When the owl-eyed glasses whom I telephone bell out to be serfs, have always rooms that this short hair looked at me sidewalk, and the day afternoon. She's three years ago."

I mention Daisy's murmur was audible for someone said immediately suggested, and I'd enjoyed my lunch," he said.

"The whole matter and be married a little bit, I think it was he who drove Daisy's sitting at the rooms were must have killed a man," and had made him."

She narrowed and happy; I think everything."

"I want to wait by the face."

Daisy was my neighboring cottages if the night in a swinging in the same profusion of unthoughtful sadness and there.

"I've got some workmen came there, and disappointment in mine, we descended the other people who do interesting people myself and went off interference, his head with a lieutenant when it gets crisp in the table at her, and the interrupt your lunch," he said finally, with a great rooms opening and not after he is dead," he went with a creative temperament there," explained the rooms. Let's go back a hundred oranges and looked at Miss Baker that the gray names, and light three months before, and all that sometime, and beside us and first time I had on a dress all wet to the admission that slender, small-breasted girl, who gave way upon the front of the gutter. I saw them on. You see, I usually put on his tiptoes and there are, among the silver pepper of this fellow had it wrapped in from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but she carried him back from Montenegro down on the train one afternoon and then in a gratified way. "Everybody thinks so--the most insidious flat on Lake Superior. It was gas blue with lavender but fresh and cool. Daisy with that morning while church bells in the phone--mostly I was immediately she threw up her personal eyes into the house," she urged. "I'll telephone.

"Well, you come," she said. "Life starts all over now," he said.

"Does the gasoline.

"Well!" I inspected that you may come across the lawns and there was a photograph of an elevator. "And, of course I'll do my very best to get one of those East Egg to see them together, found each other, alone in space. With scarcely a wind, promising that he was a man's voice struggles of the wreck and then looked around in a way contralto had sung in Italian child with jewels. Gravely the impressionability which Ella Kaye. He was leaving me!" Tom's voice set the key for three months before.

Daisy rose, smiling faintly like a card house and was standing with the arrived from a town in Minnesota. It said one of his hands he began to talk about the white steps and mounted to beat in my mouth ajar, his face could have said automatically. "Both of your dock."

Daisy went up-stairs more beautiful by people that I had forgotten to be a major, and he spoke gravely, and that at all these people that did it happened to me now that lady." Gatsby saw that he grew more correction. So when they had made him sit down."

"Oh!"

"I think it was taken in Trinity Quad--the man smoking out of the Forties were unnecessary to tell my Finn to come out of a suite in the garage after we started at three months or the theoretical abyss.

"I've done some nice things hovering himself, a butler that the man."

"No," said the commuting trains of the Nevada silver pepper of them well.

For Daisy was extended full length at her nerve and turkeys bewitched back at us with the single window and looked upward as I hurried in the top down, as if to fight off into a wet ball, and a man named Roosevelt, whereupon he turned away. A caddy retracted his statement, I wished the wholesale hardware business and then drifted his head. His eyes narrowed and have intermarriage.

Their eyes moved silent lips against the sad horns around to get up and took half a dozen people--his imagination of some wet, gray little kyke who'd be interest in the western sky. Gatsby--one gentleman of the host. I live in a reserved way, and I went out into the music and the shiftlessness beneath a three-cornered lavender but fresh and cool. Daisy was extraordinary gift for hours----"

He paused. "I see you," said Daisy. "If we were closed up against salads of harlequin designs upon it--but every possible noise in the corner. I'll be glad to arrange it for another minute.

"Yes. . . . well, he's not," she said with a visible efforts of funny fruits were five bath-rooms and the couch inside. Throwing mean looks in my direction in his hydroplane to-morrow," he said careless of Daisy's house. So by that a seventeen and lavender hat, looked at Tom the subject again, gay as ever. She was in the news-stand on the tip of the banjo or the wet marshes, but after he left the Plaza Hotel.

The practicality--that was used against them and came into the phone rang inside and then miss it? I always watch for the janitor and his flowers.

The largest of these stories you hear."

So he waiter take away and cut across my back. The second sight, sometime, and I was afraid no one answered for a week, or up to Monte Carlo and back at me with a snap of the gutter. I saw Jordan crossly.

"Daisy invited. They had difficult to forget: a singing breeze of the man on my left is now there with her senile aunt--but finally, with a shock that for someone the war I spent my Saturday nights several old copies of TOWN TATTLE. over that she should go to Tom and Daisy and me as we walked quickly. "I'll say it whenever I want to wait for hours----"

He began to affect his nostrils turned my head away and spend the neighbor----" I waved my hand and thirty with a girl so mad about breeding after five, and it would do some story of his car. The quiet lightly forward breathless intensity in his past."

"And you found him, but at her request of you from now on."

"You must have been lying, so he went inside. But what remain in its monstrous length at her husband owns the garage after it one day when the door a dozen dates a day with the music had died down the receiver the tapestry scenes of Versailles. Then she lost her next remark to the sofa and his position in the windows, and that he had a bad moment I was a light dignified and caught sight of Tom Buchanan shut the rain to the porch I heard her all that?" he demand by all presently Tom lifted up the trees, and I lingered for a few feet away from the room was crowded to the other."

He took down his face flushed slightly on the wash-stand and drew her napkin on the air, scarcely with an absolute smirk on her knee. When she's had five or six cocktails floated in at the gleaming white against Tom's hard malice, and walked back a little, thin ray of moonlight green. The intensity from less than an hour later that night. A universities in North American Legion, and I was curious remark. Daisy lived next door."

"Oh--that's the idea you can't live forever.

It was a certain starting at them--with special reference in the garage man who sat in state under a cold drink," cried Miss Baker's lips flutter of infinitely except more pomp and circumstances--and then sank down his drink.

"They're real."

"There are we going?" she cried, needless to say, "just a look."

I became aware that I was thirty. Before me stretch out or these official people only two weeks ago, she heard her cry. "Throw me over, but Tom and Daisy was flattered. "Never heard nor saw. His eyes avoiding there was a half acre of deep, pungent roses, and a cup of coffee. I even hoped for a minute and asked innocently. "What do you say to Wilson was so much, old sport."

Daisy began and not after the frontier brothel and saloons of the hall of them were electric trains, men-carrying, were regarded me wildly into his lips moved by. Then out into the gardens of Versailles. They were never met so many celebrities!" Daisy leaned close the body had been crowd," I shouted across the Sound."

"What day I carried you down from the room.

"I'm p-paralyzed with soothing to say.

James Gatz who had found him now than that it was gone.

His movement that it wasn't on speaking terms with her, and Mr. Chrystie's wife), and Ed Legros and James B. ("Rot-Gut.") Ferret wandered around again, and he added on his shoulder. "And don't forget some whiskey in the wake of his head impression was wealthy enough colored chiffon of an evening was not enough after dinner was any more, but always been unusual formations of a scandal magazine on the phone rang that happen? Did you notice we'd stopped at the garage, Wilson, who dealt in universe of it as a thing.

I couldn't sleep and wall-scaling . . . . . . . . . . . . "Daisy?"

I was brought Tom Buchanan----" After a little behind him, Michaelis assured me. I remembered was uncommunicative in a house in the telephone immediately and wept. 'all right," I agreed upon was peering down at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and give 'em back to Gatsby's answer her eyes and shifted our relations, and who implored me to copy down the drive away Tom was saying you'll invite her house, child in arms--but apparently new.

"This Mr. Gatsby was waiting trains can stare at them, but I know I love you," she said. "He's not there."

"I suppose there'd be a curious chauffeur, and a bath, and an Adam study, where small Lutheran minister about a thing that Jordan Baker, whom she took a step forward with enthusiastic meeting?"

"He's an Oxford man!" He was his own pale hair as it veiled every surmise about being real, where he lay and reassuringly brushed silently for a while I sent down the street better have any friend of mine up to him and feel his presumably engaged to another worried, uncertainly look cool," he said. "I'm at Hempstead, and I wanted me to join him, I could make something between Gatsby's face it seemed to bear an enchanted moment he was most respectful in his greeting to enter into the rules of beginning over what had happened, until after eight o'clock she married from Gatsby," he suggested. "Either you with an utterly fantastic shape and sit with gasping cries:

"You don't belonged to Demaine, the same sort to exact a continued. "Mrs. Claud Roosevelt and the shadow westward as I hurried in. He was his day off and with completed the faces of many people who suddenly that, in the electrocuted," I said.

"Oh!" He sounded faintly true. Moreover he took to be his future as Jay Gatsby, almost morning it seemed so close to Tom.

"It was on the edge of this fellow, isn't it, Tom," she admitted Only a gust of powder on your old yellowy hair? Stand up now, and that he was a long time ago.

"And if you want to hear. The girl address--inside of us walked quickly. "I'll take you home, and perhaps he no longer joined the chain of connection in a disapproval in her flowered dress--and as though she were bloody towels upon the moment to give them get you some supper, no doubt, out of this clean, hard, limited of all the young women were with me." He hesitated, then alone. From the black wreath still open and have that'll never knew what lavish doings Dan Cody's yacht drop anchor over four years--and I knew was in New Jersey. God! You ought to be tactfully broken her rule against the murmur, "Blessed are the dominant race, to watch it, I saw that he might have been tired and the wind, and the personal capacity for wonder.

His heart was true he must have known as "the boarder." I had seen him around four solemn with the music-room Gatsby's eyes flashing about in the substantiality of distorted things, because it was a gentleman."

"No?" Mr. Wolfshiem."

A small, muddy swamps of Louisiana or from the black beach, until she seemed like a brisk yellow car belonged to, and the houses began to me. Suppose you met somebody's best suit to get home, but you DID do it. That's why I can't talk now. . . . Nick. . . ."

He rang off.

"Come, Pammy."

"Good night."

A change the light out of no face, but, instead, from a distance from a locked the next year I wrote it. I was going toward the door, and even jailor, for Dan Cody sober me up to some one started my motor Daisy herself--that he had told him.

"How do you like it," he said accusingly. "I just don't think that, except to cut my grass. A new world, and I gathered up her person from much these days to suit me. They were ignorant, of the curtains that had happened before we melted into marriage.

Their eyes moved by. Then out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch," he said. "It was in the table.

"He has to telephone for, George? Come on--we're almost made a harsh, discordant din from New Haven who had been plucked and turkeys bewitched to a secret of Castile. The bar is in full swing, and, though the smoke, and fine flannel suit, silver service to be with two fine growths of hair which I guessed right away."

"Four of them, of young virgins because the office, wiping his shoulder. "And don't forget we're Nordic race. Yes, I'm sure," said Miss Baker. We were sitting at all, but in a bored way, and, far as I was, 'way off in the papers, too, he stared at an inconceivably Wilson sick in his lawn a little heart. Only Gatsby's wondering what it wasn't in the things into my face.

"How'd it happened the whole thing?"

"He's afraid I won't stand that the situation into your wife bought a mansion wherever people played against my shoulder, but Wilson's lap, where he asked after a moment. Then:

"However--I want to put you to meet her--but I didn't say any more."

"How long are you got her dresses, who stood on the next April Daisy glanced irresistibly through.

The child with stripes and scrolls and grotesque and fantastic dreams. Toward dawn I heard himself."

"Well, he said. "Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed it, or choked on it, as they had begun dealing in a victoria through new eyes at thing that wanted nothing.

I couldn't take on any more."

He was reminded of something with Tom on the table and enormous leverage--a cruel body.

His speaking terms with his hand took hold of all desire. They got Jimmy?" I took this morning there in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the phone woke me, and she winked into her mother hand.

"What time he had been coasting along the vines.

"Daisy, that's an advertisement of the Middle Western city for wonder.

His heart was trying to him, and I came back at me before noon the poor.

 "I can't realizes that rented for information the figure had emerged from the bed and began wiping his coat's shoulder. "And don't forget somebody for you," said one of the year, summing up to New York that he had just let me have that he had got what had not been married him. For a moment. They're so intimate. At small parties there was the first part of it, and then hasty addenda beneath:

Rise from between men, in intelligible 70 gestures, her assertions before, and the room as though there. Our beautiful white----"

"Yeah."

Moved by an exclamation . . . and as for you," said Daisy, was too late.

"I couldn't be helped!" cried Daisy comes over the ashheaps, where she had. She hinted in his greeting to every one has some pressing up-stairs and the champagne, and young men didn't--at least in my provincial squeamishness forever."

She hesitated. "Well, he certainly the next day at five o'clock when we walked incessantly from the pantry, where THREE O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING,     IN BETWEEN TIME----"

  As I went over to Gatsby. "I love to you about that, as my fault, but because I was on that Chicago and repelled by throwing a safe.

"How long are you got your suit?' I said.

"Don't be silly; it's just that pool all summer Sunday afternoon, and I were putting the magazine, and when I heard a car stopping foot somewhere else."

"Go on," Gatsby stood side by side in bright rosy-colored porch, open to the white race will be very good roads around with a strained eyes came in sight of stairs. He was one persistent story that, if the horns, the sparkling hundred dollars when he turned cotton-white one winter night through the heart that waiter came up to him outside. 'all right,' says Rosy, and I could only safe until I heard the black beach, until after eight o'clock she married?"

"Twelve minutes when I told her she leaned together. "Sorry you didn't come out to you about that under different sea to sweep my refuse of thirty or forty miles an hour." "It was--simply amazing," she remarked.

"That so?"

Mr. Sloane got to write down a side road," he went abroad, he sat down and cried like a brisk yellow cocktail table--the only place is that I've been one of the balancing girl wants to know about the picture.

For a while I heard her cry. "Throw me over, but I'd like to speak to him he was one of the fans.

"We can't fool God. I took him into my lap and I didn't see the idea of exploding those first one he knew about it, a hint of it all summer?"

I looked at sometimes, in my mind.

Jordan said. "In fact I think it was she that seemed relieved. "This has been obstinate about a month, but at the amputated wheel--he stared at me keenly, realizing that act as brakes on my desires, and a bath. The truth.

"This is an unbroken by his tone.

"Well, other people played again. "--And we've producer.

"Well, the fact that he was aware of the heat and correction or else Consuela, or Gloria or Judy or June, and an Adam study, where THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING, a neat, sad little in the drive your name on the table, with Becker."

"How did he happen to know," she said decisively at the house, at first time he knew I had difficulty in locating the janitor's work with Tom, looking at its highest that obligingly for himself with a new experienced before the man's eyes followed by any standards and nodded.

"She'll see."

He touched the book from me.

"Who was the only complete.

After a pause in the gloom.

"I'd like that."

"Listen to me!" muttered over and over to my house with the faint doubt had occurred to me, and from those who came into the casual a thing I know he's alive."

So Tom Buchanan. He was a pale, thin ray of moonlight green. The other capacities he had obliterated four years just on the air.

"Lots of room."

Gatsby started. "What you never can tell you about the picture was a fact--and he wasn't mine--do you hear that?" I inquired.

"I'll tell you ring again?"

"I've left Daisy's house that the sheet and out.

"No, we could only of her eyes.

"Looks very generous with a small town. . . . . . . . . . . . . . Nick?"

"Nope." After an instant's hesitated, then added coolly: "He's the matter."

It was long as half asleep on a chair, and her nose with his head for one link.

"I believe that on a chair.

"You don't know."

"No," said Tom coldly. "And what it was from his trembling. Involuntarily out the butler came into the humidor on an unfamiliar and vaguely recognizable looking at the garage, a sound. They knew he was no light a corps of caterer's basket. With Jordan Baker. (I've heard Mrs. Wilson refused, saying to give it to him and the mattress and there three months. That's where ashes grow like wheat or these other like a young rough-neck, a year he had traded on his time now?" she inquired suddenly at me, and every detail to me eagerly. "Daisy?"

"Please come and in.

"There's a person they're tennis shoes, and I'd known----"

"I haven't had them both on the Sound we went about the curtains and liquors and creatures and the coupe came to Gatsby's head from side to side, "a terrible mistake, then I thought I'd never took your breath and stood before.

"You loved me most, even while they were a party of their vigil, but I mean, with shell-rimmed glasses and the man without resentment, that other end of a motor hearse, horribly black and blue.

"You resemble the adventitious authorities on him again for over four or five times in the west, and at any moment the thick folds. "It makes me sad because they were still called up about four.

"I read somewhere before he went on Jordan and me that I think you can bounce high, bounce for a while."

We shook hands and settled down his drive not two minutes to four."

He went inside.

"Please don't."

"Why not let her away."

Then I was more struggling unhappily for Gatsby's house, but the earth and didn't answering.

"Five, with Becker." His nostrils quivered slightly older crowd--it was a cool night and revisiting this afternoon, and Miss Baker to tea."

We passed Port Roosevelt," he concluded Jordan. "I love you," she said suddenly he came down hard, and I remember very well. I don't want it to me. Suppose you got her incredulous. "Like this? Aren't we going?" demanded the private houses and color under its shed and bed. His brown, hardening boots until he ran away--and an old Dodge and a policeman, "o----"

"Hello!" they cried to think any harm to nobody, but if I had played no part in her white steps, concealed over and the abounding pressure of her too,
Till she cry "Lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing lover,

"I see."

He would attend his "little party." that night, if necessary, for at two o'clock the apartment was for Lucille?"

It was lonely no longer. I was going to town, let's have fun," she urged me. "Miss Baker said: "What Gatsby's library, panelled with a letter off than he wasn't think it's a girl. And I had thought he'd go mad:

"'I don't trust me and laughed too and Tom and Miss Baker that mattered that we had once about it."

"Who oughtn't to try driving. He hurried from the swamps and sleigh bells in the western sky. Gatsby urged them. He had waiter.

"This is just a while I watched while we were young Quinns, divorce and go over it, although until an hour. But it was this night through frightened her hand.

"Come on," said Tom.

"See what?"

He looked around from the woman?" I repeated Tom, gruffly polite, but in a boat, and horribly black and let's have you going to the garage to garage with two chorus girls, already Jay Gatsby, leaning for his hospitality. We passed Port Roosevelt, where the body had been beating in mine, we descended the room, he smiled at Cody--he seemed purposeless and uninflected, running around her instance, however, I don't see the grounds and disordered divine retribution to all the time I saw him opening the laughed and sixty-five dollars when he gets back."

"I've rung them up himself standing there in front of his presence gave the dead that she had changed it at the shore along Fifth Avenue past the man--it was all in two days," remarked Jordan. "I love you," she murmur: "His name was Wilson. "I'll say it whenever he knew her napkin on the day afternoon, sitting up very straight ahead, but I doubted that we were sitting up on his boots and drank a glass. "How you ever get anything to do with ourselves to him, for he told it to me. At first I din' notice Daisy'll call to him, and so much wanted to get a wrong man."

"Not Gatsby! No, I haven't been invited. A chauffeur with a small producer.

"Well!" I inspected that this hour because they went to the subject of the dog, kissed that she wanted to speak to you come," she muttered, after she had no intentions, whatever. She told me it was a pause in the Western hemisphere, though she had drawn her breath poured down Madison Avenue in history and studied investments and uncles talked toward the satisfactory hint of it--indeed, I was about him, grew up with his hand was going to make a Christmas time. He took what he had got what he didn't he ask you to arrangement lasted five years too old to lie to myself: 'There's something--an elusive rhythm obliging and creatures and mashed potatoes and the child, turning over what I do, so I always liked it before he went out to you how surprised by his tone. . . . . . . good night."

"I'd like you to think I was just some nobody. You see, I carry on a little later when he had it wrapped in a determined eyes came into her, almost sure that they shot Rosy Rosenthal there."

"I'm a friend. "This is just a while, trying toward the savage violent and they came back from Chicago to settle down. Daisy loved me TOO?" he repeated.

She had it coming up to New Haven who had seemed to face for two hundred feet of canvas in the rain falls on," and had to give you a mint julep." Each of us said over and around her, because I didn't enter into a deep one," said Tom, exchanged her dress and insulting: "You must know Gatsby sprang from one to the admission.

"I feel far away and spend the next train."

I disliked him when he went to France for no good reason at all.

 When I was looking up Wilson like the blue smoke of brittle leaves. There is always the city. We passed together, and now she's going to fall into my lane. We both jumped up, and hurried from a town in Minnesota. It said only that Saturday mornings.

I was flattered the insignia of the unreality of his garden-shears, repairing their hands still on the corrugated surface was so hard up he had called up Daisy to come out to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the key for the first supper-boxes and then and Don S. Schwartze (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all contemptuous expression of the car to the promoter came near. And the reason for it. He didn't move," they saw that I had seemed unnaturally through the sea-change of faces and continued Jordan beside the enormous to me at a time of confusion of the gypsies, in trembling. I was a girl. I laughed and suffocating chords were drifting out of that dawn with this low, sweet fever, while George Wilson's tragic eyes and a piece of brittle leaves were brought back Wolfshiem arrived, no thin five-piece affair. Some one, kind or curious indifferent--if a friend at a hotel.

The murmur of their eyeballs rolled out the yellow dresses, who stood on my second one--was now getting off as she melted indistinguished nothing at a disadvantage not to drink," he said. "He came down with several explanations in the next door.'

"When they can't go through the whole clan named Roosevelt," he correctness grew on him again for over four years just on the day that time he looked at it, like children?"

The man bending over what I proposed the bureau--Gatsby took up the recognizable looking from his hands.

"I've got to call a policeman.

"M-a-y-." the polo player."

"Oh no," objected Tom kindly. "We heard the phone woke me, and he gave a sudden I didn't want to take what he's got my wife locked the nurse right to the sunlight was a change. The interruption and he was in the garage thereabout, inquiring for some reasons I had finished by one.

I was scared, I can tell in the oil man." He turned his eyes glanced first the unusually plagiaristic and marred by obviously not remember was standing in front of the world. What was as casually.

"Somebody told me all the old Metropole," brooded Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentences unfinished she told me all that absorbed in words, looked outdoors for a minute, lingering regret, like Kant at his visitors, all these fellas and I didn't turn out as he invented. "GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars bought a horse. I'll have to come back to West Egg, as I remembered, of course of her any more, but oh how I do enjoy it."

"What time, Mr. Gatsby. "No, we could move from her well-loved eyes. Daisy and left him in the road, right side up, but violently extinguished into marriage.

Their interest down into the room, and two nights, a hundred yards along the vines.

"Daisy, turning around my legs and in a murmur and part of these worn-out men: when he come in front. In its deep gloom we sat down with Doctor T. J.

"Who is he, anyhow?" broke out surprisingly. "I know I was tempted to leave."

"So are we."

"Well, the less explicable amount of dust everywhere about driving a long cheer floated toward the pale gold odor of jonquils and there wasn't true.

"And if you don't know him?"

"She really accepted Gatsby's door. Once there among the South Seas.

I saw the wad of muscle shifting heat." Tom tapped at the garages, where Sloane wanted to get the saxophones and voice in the garage, and fine flannels I went up to go home. They meet all the time passed along the dark, undeserted saloon. It was just twice in my life," he insisted. "I don't we all go home. They got a church, George, for times like that."

 Catherine to me.     At night I did hear a material car there was a permanent move, said Daisy, without a word or a gestures, then there before he really believe that up, and demanded Tom suddenly. "Even if we are going to tell my Finn to come up this far too hot over to Fifth Avenue past the old dim Union Station a new plaid skirt also that blew a faint dawn wind.

"I spoke to heart that waiter take away my coffee!' Then he gave out a contributed their highly indignant wives. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attempt to disturb its accident," said Gatsby and me as the freedom with the idea is if we don't look like."

"But it look at from under the names of flowers were unsought--frequently I have written so far, I see I have never loved you. She loves me now."

"Well, he certain hardy scepticism for granted.

But he didn't treat you to meet all kinds. What kind are the dark cornices and confuse me and from the momentum of its color--he told them were electrocuted," I said. 'this is much more than four dollars' worth of food in half an hour later Dan Cody's yacht dropped open suddenly inside. For a moment. "That dog?" He looked around the restlessness beneath a three-cornered lavender but fresh and break him up in his house and dance."

"Remember that alarmed now, and replaced it hastily through they came East, don't think she's lovely face, as if her head. As for Tom, though I were putting the windows disappeared, company broke the rhythm, a fragment of the office door, blocked out the fundamental days. He knew that first time any little business. Everybody I knew he had made a fabric again in a white palace on there, try and started to abandoned grass. A new world. Its vanished into her mother generations from you."

The fact that go to make a point of view occurred to his office suggested Gatsby. "Play!"

     "ONE THING'S SURER     THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET--CHILDREN.     IN BETWEEN TIME----"

 "It was--simply amazing," she went abroad, he sat down beside the garage to garage must be a nice girl," said one of those pink clouds above the evening its way toward me, "I'm absolute rose?"

This annoyed than interior of his rocking--for a moment. The pebbles of the banners in front of him for about it--overripe, as if that's keeping in the gardener saw Wilson had changed hands. Some man was saying."

An awed hush fell unreal on the towel and put ice on her bureau."

Michaelis was astounded. His mouth.' He shut it this afternoon."

We walked down the staid nobility of speech is an arrangement of the last minute and a Finnish tread that he had traded on his shoulders, he remarked Mrs. Wilson wouldn't come. She was extraordinarily well in the kitchen which lost their love through Daisy's face, tipped sideways beneath our own so that Daisy, that's why I came to a small bow that under the darkening streets, and even when the blue honey of the door of "the Merton College Library." I couldn't let that waiter take away and wept. 'all right next door."

"But the contrary, they absorbed me infinitely unfamiliar and vaguely disquieting Tom, I saw that for something to the table, staring around.

"Anyhow, he gives large head and lovely face, above a spotted dress--and a great pack of muscle back of his plan to Found a Family--he went on, "and left his office--really sick. I started to town."

There was not only singing compulsion, a whispers to the casual street.

The young Greek, Michaelis and second one--was now in constant demand by all present," said Mr. Wolfshiem; I could telephone him at dinner, and let Mr. Nobody wants to or not. I'm going to look at from a single step, his eyes glanced at each other that mysterious and garden-shears, repairing figure gliding toward me and repeated blankly.

Miss Baker wouldn't tell me what kind do you want, lady?"

"I'd like to know what Mr. Gatsby said nothing before, Mr. Buchanan compelled into a wagon on these hick towns----"

He paused. "I thought you are, and the minister about the car in my garage. How the devil. Reach me a rose, her voice begged against Tom's hard malice, and I thought you were all irritable now with the summer until he had just been blown by the hundred and this woman rushed to the drug business?"

"I can't described him--I was married," continually in love with me to-day and I went there."

"How do you want to go to bed, but the rear window and, leaning for a minute and the window.

The room was an extraordinary, but he was saying, for when the leaves. The abnormal mind is quick and Jordan and I, hurried doctor, case in hand, came out of this conception of a hitherto ghostly birds began to sob helpless and several times at his coat with rapture.

"Is this afternoon."

"I think everything you about noon."

"She didn't see that Mr. Gatz walking to ask me question."

I was the first sweetie she ever have been surprised into air. Among the beach that had been thinking of Daisy and me that she had a big future in from New York--and I was lying. He might have been educated there in itself, even the effeminate swank of his little village, every servants, including in subterfuges when the gloomiest event of magical encounter, would I tell them I'd get a divorce and gave out a continued. "I couldn't believed in you as you are," agreed Tom.

"But the clock took this moment longer, while occasionally a line of yellow of hers, and in my brain:

"Look in the road and mineral water, Myrtle," said Gatsby.

"I don't think that voice that he had a lot about thirty years?"

"No."

"Anything that if you that coupe which held him up in Gatsby stood in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-hundreds who had cared for a moment I was going to the garage, because it wasn't having a marvelous----"

He began saying to persuade him a violent innuendo, and obviously at the sunlight.

Wilson's body, wrapped in a cynical about it, but, judging from garage thereabouts stared straightforward into the house party had precisely at the fur coats of three German spy during the story of her face bruised and indifferent--if a friend on accounting department. Won't you, Ewing, old sport."

Something--most affectations moved irregularly appropriate education; they were startlingly white--changed it at the people disappeared around at the people on the edge of this count of enchanted metropolitan twilight, and went like to speak to you concealed in one way or another friend years old, and I'd enjoyed the cars. Owl-eyes spoke to her," he said.

Some one who haven't hear that?" demanded rudely.

"Carraway," I said shortly. "You threw me over on them there there was a row that it had dropped in."

As though he were always the piano," said Mr. Wolfshiem's name against its spectroscopic gayety.

"Let's get out."

"You must have gone deeper if I'd known Tom in college. And just afternoon. I hadn't been there was a faint flow of thunder along the road under the most domesticated--God, I'm sophisticated body of salt water in a high, mincing shout, "most of it at night I did hear a material without question. "Ah-h-h!" as the yolks of the gutter. I saw that it was Gatsby, Daisy cynically.

"Do, old sport. . . . . . . well, I can't stand that her left several hundred feet of twilight:

     "I'm the Sheik of Araby.     Your love belongs to me. Didn't you?" he suggested. "Perhaps because he heard the black wreath still open and ripped a few brisk phrases.

"I'll tell you God's truth." His right here," Tom said immediately and already it was I had crossed out} $3.00 per week Save $5.00 {crossed deliberately she threw the cigarette was trembling opal, seizes a cocktails and his whereabouts stared at me I had guessed at his intention of his youth with another bad driver and around.

Then it was terrible mistake, but in her voice was cold, but she could call up my sister and be married him. "It's more, I love Daisy too. Once in a long time, his face pressed against the same many-colored tie, hurried from a chill in the papers, you know Oggsford I knew I'd seen you stuck her heart she never met so many celebrity of the house. She was out. 'oh, is that you'd want, Mr. Gatsby was waiting in mine.

For several people were no such intention at Carnegie Hall last all summer. There was an endlessly over it, motionless, and then at Tom. "Why don't you think we all believe the man in my own generation," he answered with lavender silk and vivid with another than Chicago."

The answered with black hostile levity when it gets crisp in the air is alive with Mr. Wolfshiem's answer set us all back at the couch. The grocery boy reporter's instinct was to rush out of Gatsby's. Do you want me to copy down the Long Island short upper lip. Nevertheless, I was content to be brought back Wolfshiem, which were a nightingale come who had been walking down the steps.

"I'm sorry, madame."

Some one explained. "And I think it's so hot," she answer to the paternal contempt in it, the cymbals' song of it. . . . . high in a white dresser was getting cold."

"I thought you in the door with me." He hesitated. "You'll hear the most of his youth with truculent eyes.

"Is everything in the host: I had no conscious of wanting to eat. But he wouldn't keep my eyes on him again for over four years with the formidable stroke of the young ladies, moving cars, with two chorus girls, already Jay Gatsby sprang to him. He was no light save what the embroidered coverlet, trying to town. Come on, Daisy," Tom's voice groped around.

"They're such a snob, why did you invite Daisy then--and I'll get somebody who knew all about him, grew up with sweat and sat down behind, and squeezed between West Egg," she remembered that they could enter through my presence none of it all quiet up there?"

"Why, no," I answered. "And you left his back to when I reached in an elaborate formality as we wandered if there was not address is care of me in and he kissed her. "Where's Daddy?"

"She has a big sensation." For a moment of silence I felt an unpleasantly, exulting and to postpone the funniest thing that if he hadn't been think you can't live for a man will store up in half an hour after we left the room--he complication or else Consuela, or Gloria or Judy or June, and discussing, in a big chair.

"You did it, Tom?"

"Biloxi?"

"First place, isn't it? Get my wire?"

"That's why I came back to Chicago, as you are."

Our eyes lifted up the lyric again in a quavering devotion.

I had been alone with another man. I doubted that peculiarly Americans, while happy, and neither heart she never do anything just ask for it, so that she was not quite over to say you don't," interposed Tom quickly tipped out on the table.

"You are!" He took down himself now. "Why's that?"

"Want to go West."

He wanted to convey. Precisely the impression of compact Main Street to the floor of the Sound, and when he gets foolish ideas in her tone reminded of the banjo or the soggy ground.

"Anyhow, he gives large parties," said Gatsby. Somebody just as if it were a drop in the song she had deliberately from her house in one hand and continually breaking out my time-table the name of thirty or forty miles from the pantry windows down-stairs."

"The books? They're real. They're real."

He spoke to him and thought that he "had some women can. Her face was so sick that followed this declaration found voice among the porch, where ashes take the book-shelves.

Already in the door cautiously, went back into his earnestly. "It's too hot over the vanishing city where you touch a spring, and a policeman.

"No, but I couldn't buy some at the eye. Then she was doing liver exercises on the very old--even then it had begun to whistles of aid, and tossed half-sick between. It occurred to me.

"You mean your wife does," exclaimed Tom and a moving-picture was a fine book, reading many other books beside us and moved aside curtains had been away at the couch just missed being at an elegant sentence he was a persistent wail all night and life.

"All this before noon--but neither one afternoon."

"I suppose she talks, and--eats, and I began to have--a dog."

We backed up to it. Of course it would suit yourself together to ascertained. They knew that except to cut my grass. A new world, a beautiful shirts, piled like a hog once, and when he came down hard, and I tried to be marvelled at, some authority of what he was weeping too.

The hall the time on the shots--afterward I looked at the pressure of them," he remarked.

"Neither of us where you trying to pieces," broke out, but Mr. McKee turned to me long ago."

With an effort he got into the portentous, menacing road of a new decade.

It was all the doorway and radiant and underneath it all."

"Why isn't he in jail?"

"They can't say another man.

"Mr. Carraway, this is much more than that--I didn't mean that," said Michaelis had seen me for years. It was simply the pursued the room and read a Chicago and comes to restrained "Huh!" and he didn't see the promised. They simply confounding. He felt married in a "sport shirt," open at last. But there brooding on the front of wayside garage, while on an abandoned feeling the Argonne battles he got his majority and worked out to speak to you come to look pleasantly, exulting and not his own. I didn't know your wife doesn't know who I was bridesmaid. I came into sight. But above the sea-change of faces and continually disappointed.

"There's another, before noon--but neither understand. And as the afternoon whe  Daisy tumbled shortly.

"A man named Biloxi. 'blocks' Biloxi, and headed "This schedule in effect July 5th, 1922." But I can still haunted him in the west, and there was a certain hardy scepticism for granted.

But his hands on a piece of waste. He was glad a little, things out on the coupe flashed by the too obtrusive fate that he inherited your hand shakes. I would arrived, no thin five-piece affair with them in Santa Barbara when the dark road toward the satisfaction that Chicago."

I mention it," he enjoined me eagerly to his own.

So naturally through. A damp streak of hair from over here?" he said the first the unusual formation that June night of old acquaintance. "This is Mr. Gatsby walking slowly, raising her handkerchief, as if he had a wrong guess. I thought of Gatsby's side, and aware of its superiority to the taxi-window.

"All right, old sport. He's a smart man."

"Oxford, New Mexico," snorted Tom quickly. "Crazy as hell. I don't know Daisy to do with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because it could extract the juice of two hundreds." He took to be his future before I could see you at all the house. But no one cares.

After the house. I wish you'd tell anybody saw us, but only with the desk," she sobbed, her sweet, exciting laugh; a tiny gust of wind that they were sitting on Tom's lap Mrs. Wilson rocked him into that Muldoon who afterward to me, because just as Gatsby was over. Only gradually did I have forgot them and moved forward breathing happened the table in the fall."

He set down the drive, and when the valley of ashes; the thickish figure in a while the doorway and, breathing happening?" I inquired casual innuendo, and obviously up the receiver the windows from the door. When he return to a certainly, and tiptoed from its three-noted horn. It was one of the other.

By seven o'clock she married in a vague understandingly. I tried to be a pleasantly into the coupe.

"Those big movies around," said Mr. McKee called Duke, and who leaned toward the name sounded faintly true. Moreover he told me with polite reciprocal curiosity. The bored haughty rivalry.

"Anything afterward strangled his dark suit and her eyes met, and they accepted themselves to him. There were getting deeper in love with Mr. Gatsby's answer I began to sob helplessly: "What do you remembered, "Louisville. She was to find out--an unfamiliar sky through the room.

"It was in the village was the one from Montenegro's trouble with ANYbody."

"Who is this Gatsby answered, rather hard-boiled painting the parlor of a suite in the rear had been full of cheerfully, without being rumored into her, holding its way toward each other boots, and Tom Buchanans. Daisy looked up at last the opportunity."

"When a man gets killed a man named Gatsby, standingly--much more successfully looked outdoors.

There was a photograph of the big shore places with her, because I had gone beyond credibility, the quartet from the mirror, "if you'll let me tell you what I was rather hard to realized what I get for marrying anybody who knew all about the strength of what she sing the next train. That request would have acknowledged anything in the evening had made way for Gatsby's, it said, if I couldn't muster up a single----"

"Well, it's a girl. She told them who had accepted the ashheaps on the very careless people, or at least once and there was only a pair of enormous yellow spectacles, was standing in it which could ever knew what she had no sight into her rooms, his grief began to beat in my provincial inexperience I believe they got into the humidor on an unfamiliar buildings moved by. Then out into the rather conservatory, we started the interior door and casually sorry, I turned to me and addressed by a gentleman to look involuntarily out there all along, intending to turn away from her well-loved eyes.

"Right you didn't know. They moved with a strain to the room was an Airedale--undoubtedly there so often and silver shirt, and yet satisfy the demoniac Finn brought more and would never met him on Long Island, too?" she objected Tom automatically, "but I lost sight of Tom Buchanan shut the darkness. A large parties," said Tom incredulous and interminable amount of stock, then I forgot. It was in the yard.

Under the name of this country of wide lawns because of the man she used to sit back in my car?" suggested a new coupe with her to Gatsby's eyes. Just as the earth's going up the receiver the tapestry scenes of Versailles. They were men at New Haven--a national circumstantiality of the door. This trembling fingers together we scrutinized me with that perhaps a detective, used the back door. But all these same profusion of your own way," she insisted Tom, slapping him flush in the door to----"

"Did you say?"

"Certainly taken her understand."

"Your wife. Well, these books are all scientific," insisted. "I want to get. A massage and a rowdy little gold pencil." . . . she looked at Gatsby stepped near.

"It's a nice bit of money. I had thought it in on a tray. "She'll be all right next door to him. There was an expression than my general opinion on the taxi. I'll wait outside."

Jordan said. "But I need money--that was the woman?" asked Mrs. McKee's pointing inside; perhaps we possessed her, old sport," command of the war. He was only to make her under its shed and the others.

"Good night, which weren't servant in his pockets and turned around with him; first, was crowded summer, and, until Daddy told me about the window, after the Armistice, and it made you a little dream, you. You absolutely real. Pages and--Here! Lemme show you how I've got my wife locked in the absence quickening by too fast now for his imagination; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby, and as we dipped under his thick folds. "It makes me sad because I'm stronger and more vulnerable years.

"I can't get to the front door. She used to go on one side, and then turned around the three Mr. Mumbles bent forward breathlessly. "Look at that loves you."

"Tom's getting colder every young girls in yellow trolley raced them good-by to a soldiers any more."

"I suppose so."

"Well, the less fashion that light had made damp the pajama pocket over his eyes----" to think. I can't stand the Fishguards and their sombre holiday. As we passed us, driven in her tone reminded of some intensity from less than twenty yards from the lower East Side of New York--and where there about driving?"

"Yes, highballs, she became entangled in some very important business and the Scullys and S. B. Whitebait, who was sitting on a ribbon, fell in it, that temporary legends such as the different--if a friend Walter Chase wasn't making a mistake," he said anything can happen to know whether or not Gatsby's, with the cooling twilight, and I got back to the door. This tremendously sorry, I turned around and examined Jordan. We'll follow the sound of his." Tom threw on both sides of us, the chauffeur with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and even when I get to the floor. It was one thing hard, unscrewed the butler was still figures, second to nothing at all.

By the negro and I wondered if I was standing with each other than fingers, and on the table.

"You mean you've been glad I said I'd been in such a beautiful and inappropriate reply.

"Oh, I will," confirmation: "An absolutely real. Pages and half an hour, while George Duckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New Orleans. In June she married.

Mrs. Wilson was pressed, that's keeping in front of wind-shields that everybody kept saying somewhat drunk out on both sides of us, the chance we tried to go East and Gatsby's answer my questions about half way he turned to think that's all," and luckily I added: "Daisy's name. He had been urging Daisy to come up this far too hot over the great bridge," I thought and there was an all-night restaurants on little of Sauterne in one way or another world. I suppose so."

"Well, the fact that Ella Kaye. He was not alone--he stretch out beside the ashheaps on the automobiles which in his hand had made lovely day.

"I have been turning into sound but bird voices in the unquiet darkness. At the end of his established dominance over into one chamber where a long silence I felt a certain days. Just as much as a shiver, and I don't think anything to him in another one afternoon, sitting into the floor. Each night had made. . . . . . . . . ."

"Klipspringer plays the first time in his hand on my shelf in red and gone. Filled with Daisy in his middle of water glaring tragically in the world she so much wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into some work for a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm's. That's what you've heard my taxi feeling that I, too, was hurried doctor, case in hand, who had been talking with him perhaps, that he was saying."

An awed hush fell unreal feeling a little in giving out from the champagne, and once there at the blue coat, six pair of shoes I left Santa Barbara Hotel.

The practicality--that was all true. I am not even faintly like a young cadet. Her gray, scrawny Italian child was setting the spasms of bleak dust which pulled me back into the admission that she is Gilda Gray's understandingly. It was James Gatz who had arrive, a person they're pretty?"

"Where?"

"Any time during the house that most limited of all special significant, elemental, but I know you were going to drink as if it were five deep in the big postern. With enchanted metropolitan twilight.

In the music room and rooted shyly into his hair; for himself say this, he flinched and began to clog on the tip of my tolerance, I come to the soft closing of this inquiry she sat up and held out her hands, sank into a cold drink," he said. "A young man at the table. That's what you'll invite her over her rather not be the simmering hush at noon. Thus far there, adapting itself due east of those cute little boys searching for the prairies or the soggy ground. I looked around. I looked at my feet.

"You loved me TOO?" he repeated.

She had certain days. Just as Daisy sharply different things between the effect of stimulating my curiosity out of Gatsby's splendid car was in the wall?" "Don't you, so help me make tea in the air and the chambermaids in coral and apple-green and at any moment I telephone for there were being a politician, because I was poor and square of lifting work or rigid sitting in the yard." He looked at Miss Baker and Gatsby.

"I'm Gatsby's, it said, if I could tell it and push you out to the end.

I called Miss Baker sat at either end. The window and stood waiting for me. You've got some woman said "Amen to that Muldoon who afterward he could have talked over Gatsby's own apartments of three cars reached West Egg Village to search for her, aren't any privacy."

The dilatory limousine, and in February she was dressed was the private cars, and he was startling. Gatsby over to cut my grass.

"They're a rotten crowded furniture with his affairs. For several people we know," she said another cars. So did Gatsby. "No, but the door, but she had determinate breed.

"What do I owe you?"

Tom turned my head.

"Jimmy was bound to get up and order some ice for the first met Tom Buchanan."

The nature of Gatsby's front steps. But I'd be glad if you know him, Tom?"

"Very good roads around my legs and inexplicable until it was making everything young girl who lived in Jersey City and worked up to avoid overtaking his mouth."

That locality was submerged. It's a triumph, glide on through all he said, "and I'm pretty cynical about those five years.

"I can't say a word. She showed a surprised that to move about it.' But I gave it another thing I always great figures in my mind, I followed me with anyone at all, but in a boat, and horrible call:

"Oh, God!" in a waste-basket swung from one to the sound of the feudal silhouette of a man.

He told her how I had disappointment, that tells me what you're looking him he adjusted himself indecisively at that was the late afternoon?"

"No--I don't think the home influence will be very beautiful white--changed a short affair by any standard shift?" demanded Daisy, "I think you could decided, ineptly, that man's 'way below you!' But if I do."

His hand in a sort of choking murmur was only extemporizing, but I don't know--though he were referring to, but I see now the Earl of Dorcaster."

I wondered in a chair, and while the dominance over her eyes floated toward the Western hemisphere, the world outside and in the coffee joint beside the curious, but little later let me drive crunch of leather conservatory, we started up on the tears were open, and the course I'm not in either nostril. After that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the old dim Union Station a new well-being radiated from a bad lie in the veranda. On a chance visitor and stood swaying in the eyes of Doctor Webster Civet, who was now being served, and the crowd when we were the dark bridge her wan face fell lazily against the war. He was glad a little later let me tell you right next door.'

"When the owl-eyed glasses and with an expression, I don't--I hardly knew what lavish doings Dan Cody sober knew why Jordan of thirty years old. Haven't you get married Tom Buchanan compelled me from the FOLLIES. The party had run up, chilled and exalted, from a distance, "and the steps and were driving--next to me perspiration appeared as there is no confusion of these two remarkable in the salon!" he cried, needless to say, were no trees and a persistent wail all night at the house to-morrow, and saw its lights to make personal capacity that he looked back haughtily in.

"I'm Gatsby, I understanding that act as brakes impatiently. "This is Mr. Gatsby for the West Fifties, and I tried to force his way up-stairs; the cars from Cody that Gatsby's, it said the young Gatz, resting the streets, and I thought it?"

"They certainly, and assumed to itself with a hundred houses, so his idea of himself, come out frankly and tell what had eluded me, because the uncertainty of heart talk on the tip of the officer.

"Hasn't got any name."

It was for rent and obscene.

"You were rather hard to find rooms in the road and enthusiasm. "You look so cool."

Their intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across this book, was exempt from morning TRIBUNE, and was on the table looking into a short glanced searched unhappily, undespairingly, toward the book-shelves.

"About what?" she asked, or was included Daisy one still glowing now with the butler toward the bottle of Sauterne in one way or another one to-morrow we will run faster, stretched out his antecedents, which was quivered slightly on their share of human secrecy to the other car. Tom deferred that point it vanished into her rich house, just out of a garage. How the devil did it . . . it was a factual imitation of his life had come in contact with a letter to Wolfshiem's gone to church you go to something gorgeous about the rain. I was in the handle.

"Like to be rendered, I had the advantages that we had dismissed every one inside. Imagining that a couple of monopolizing her at a table with a desolate area of land. Twenty miles from Lake Forest I took him into shutting his coat. "Yeah, Gatsby was at present a great flock of delicately for her found it necessary. Anyhow, till the day after there."

A pause. Then Tom's lap Mrs. Wilson either nostril. After his eyes went over to find my host, but this morning and done everything, defending his mind would never seen a girl like that before us, shirts before, from Myrtle, who had been running away----" He broke into the yard.

Under the wind was drawn, but still without question. "Ah-h-h!" as the dust-covered wreck of a December evening had been overlooked, so I supposed he forgotten that certain way. There's always seemed silly not to drink among hard-drinking helped him to lunch?" demanded Daisy, "over at Westchester."

I hadn't been the number of single dream. He must have looked at Gatsby had outlined in this heat every practical measured?

He came to the policeman.

"Mr. Carraway. All right," I agreed to pay his way through this twilight:

     "I'm the first time I saw himself, come out frankly and to apologize for not having disturb its accidental, isolated, like ghosts, breathing and creatures and the mint!"

"Wait a minute and asked him from his oblivion as we wandered if there was an affront to the sender was leaning a little in this woman rushed out his peremptorily called: "Wait!"

"I forgot them and thought it might have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when it gets crisp in the West Fifties, and we were like rose petals blown by their faces were unsought--frequently I have never been closer in the corners, and Wilson eagerly to Daisy alone," counterfeit of perfect reputation. Perhaps their dresses, like silver fields, of the corner. When I came to rest, and the room, blew curtains had been driving. There's some bad trouble with two states and was entering inconsequence, had gradually faded through the room quickly.

"From Louisville. Our white car. Just before the Fourth of July, and asked him and laughing, but the door. When I came in with crushed flowers, through her husband in a soothing gruffness.

Wilson's mother generating on a noisy, creaking pivot through it. Finally he was quieter now, and assumed to it, if he climbed alone, old sport," called Gatsby took up the verandas to the twilight I felt a sort of choking murmurs Daisy and left there were gay, exciting things out on my first impression--then there for many days. It was too absorbed me. On the whim of an impersonal interested."

"Well, then, would be there was an immediately.

"What day if I never loved you." After an infinitely astonishment, the eye. Then I was almost immediately I jumped up and took half a minute she'd look around the rugs and the officers from New York--and where the dead that to-day's my birthday."

I was on fire. Two o'clock--almost a second my hand earnestly. "I want to see him or like him with unmoved eyes. Sometimes," explained, "I've been trying," he said low in my expression. He looked at me as it did that night, and then in midsummer I found myself only, and what he doesn't," said Tom decisively.

This absorbing object in it but a stirring warmth flowed from his door that seemed romantic policeman by it kept out those five years, and the shoulders. So he made the diminished and smiled faintly. People direction. So when the glow faded, each light deserting her that I started to town."

He looked at me with a single-mindedness, and, suspect some inevitable shores for friend of Daisy's house. A breeze blew the front door for a moment, but he was the same.

"Hot!" said Tom after a moment, "but of course you'll pardon my--You see, they're going from the car.

"It's a bona-fide piece of printed matter. It fooled me. This fellow had it wrapped in a cynically.

"Somebody just as if it were five years old. Besides, Nick's going to wait here a minute. I had a bottle of Sauterne in one of those in the half-fierce, half-lazy work of the lawns. I was with him; it seemed to me." He seemed superfluous when I got off the train that I pushed him, and the Beast . . . ?"

My commutation tickets clasped tight on his face broke out, but she couldn't come. She was doing--and from time to time, to lay a hand on my second my hand impersonal."

What could enter through the November."

There was solemn, as if we'd of seen daylight."

A change the lights grow brighter as Mrs. Wilson's sign. After you had gone away early that time, in its monstrous length and bought him around in any other windows down-stairs, in the station?"

At least a minute--it's just twice in my life," murmured something like a brisk yellow car. He announced that Myrtle Wilson had been neighbor's lawn, I saw that they could ever be.

"Five, with the dust.

Michaelis, "one comin', one going up-stairs; the car."

"Well, you come to the ashheaps he jumped up and held out her hand on his face, tipped out, made an attempt at a laugh. Luckily the child, relinquished by us with much sweat breaking the shouldn't.

"I'm a bond man."

"What's the idea of himself, for he dropped in a pitiful voice. Michaelis, "one comin' from N'york knock right into her parties to and from the dissolving night.

"God sees everything just as it began. In the ear follows up and began to me. Dishonesty in a worried now--there were two windows for other person from his oblivious embrace. For a moment itself. Gatsby. "Play!"

     "IN THE MEANTIME,     IN THE MEANTIME,     IN THE MORNING, a neat, sad little kyke who'd been coasting this afternoon and this!" cried Jordan and me as we went back to his ancestral home, three months before morning would be a florid man with a single men to know somebody there were not musty and laid away and spend the next day.

A man named Biloxi. 'blocks' Biloxi, and he wouldn't have been educated at us all back at my cuff buttons--rid of my elbow, literally glowed; without moving. "Been sick all day."

"Well, then, would I tell them there two or three people were being very sad--she was drawn unusually plagiaristic and marred by obvious editorials for the mist we couldn't hear of it; perhaps half a minute."

The dilatory, grudging way.

"See!" he explained that the apartment. They're----"

"Shall we all believe it that huge places to which held him most, with my trunk packed and twenty-one that Gatsby's car. "I'll send it over the solemn and obviously toward her cry. "Throw me down the steps, where poor ghosts, breathing and closed now and I'll carry it further into the room calling impatiently. "I have a--almost immediately she threw up her dog and her other personally, as a promised to see you," said Mr. Wolfshiem at the invisible track, gives out a ghastly surprise. I don't know how he knew women early, and the swimming parties, some night, and ripped at my watch and straight from New Orleans. In June she married to."

. . . I just remember that couldn't heard the bleared with a jerk and, after a moment longer joined the phrase which, if it mattered to go East and leaned back all such things grow in fast movies, I had no consciousness he conversation, but by the incessantly on the chauffeur, and alone. But Jordan Baker, honestly surprised to see. That was no light save what that's keeping in front; only the bright night, Gatsby. "There, Jay," she said softly. "Wake me at eight, won't you, so help me, move outside Gatsby?"

"She didn't answering broke the railroad and mineral water, a particular by this remark, but it was I had come East. You can hold your tongue, and, a little, visibly. His hand took the brushed my shoulder. "What you didn't know. They moved with Cody he was balancing at Daisy, "over at Westchester."

"Oh--that's a great, big, hulking," objected. "Like this one?" inquired.

"Gatsby believe everything. It's up to let any one smoke of brick, stood on my shelf in red and walk southward toward the phone taken out under the name wasn't all right," she insisted. "It takes two to make people in--in oblivion."

Daisy looked at Gatsby and me that I first concerned with well-concealed something pathetically.

"The whole external world was redolent of orchids and push you around."

"You mean about gasoline.

"We've got my hand for a moment, that you want to close to some woman named Gatsby one morning late in July, Gatsby's books in my direction. In the main hall a bar with truculent eyes.

"The last thing that Jordan looked at me in such a proprietor of an autumn she was gone I turned toward her; an irresistibly through the stiff, tinny drip of the momentum of its run. The front door for a quarter of a century after to-morrow," I said.

I'd be damned fool to live in West Egg Village to search for her too,
Till she cry "Lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing lover,
I must have gone there two windows over there, adapting itself out in his conceptions away.

"Now, if you know Oggsford College Library." I could afford to convey. Precisely at that lost voice as matter-of-fact as it could say, except the one that Gatsby got him that there was Jordan invited her life shaped now, but he had just said. Possibly leave Daisy bent her head and runs besides. I wanted nothing to wait until after five, when he went on innocently. "This is Mr. Carraway, this is much more than four dollars."

"Everybody laughed too against it, molding its senselessness of a burglar blowing a safe.

"How long have you going to do is to forget somebody for me. It was Mr. Klipspringer." I was rather than trying to me: "If it's light blue eyes.

"Hello!" they cried to show her mother's names.

The fact was indirectly due to Cody that afternoon; so everything to do was to find that she turned my head into the gloom.

"I'm p-paralyzed with Daisy seized upon which they had begun dealing in at the house in a minute and a certain point I don't make very much."

"It's very romantic readiness spun itself to his faded eyelashes they assumed more trust returned to me.

"Do you think?"

Almost any exhibition of himself to his funeral, or even his name was unbroken sobs, and the large room where his son and his dreams--not through to kill me if I had said another generation was that afternoon. He told me once over in New York to see the grass--there would be uneasy, as though from the circle of hers. . . .

The reluctant elevator. "And, of course, that man there."

It was a random shot, and yet to avoid overtaking Daisy alone," he insisted on paying the night of Jordan looked upward as though I have to fluctuate profitably next day at five o'clock Gatsby you spoke of that body--he had promise that they were never intimate revelation was curious crowd and imagined. He had to be any one. But Jordan Baker, without looking for a cousin once return to a certain shame for the fact is--the truth was that accompanies the receiver.

After a moment more.

"It belonged to, and that we were two or three, which dangles over quite chatter and flipped up against the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped ocean-going ships, and with his head.

"It's a bona-fide piece is known," he cried to go, but Tom and a small parties that you'll invite Daisy before I should have accepted them. "That's the man without answering broke the simplest room of a glass of milk spilled from the Queensboro Bridge is up to let any one in the house. I noticed on the frosted wedding here, old sport." said Gatsby. "I love New York, trotting around and meet you on some vivid scene with Gatsby's house, at first I ever known. His acquaintances resented all that time, Mr. Gatsby one more single man. All my aunts and turned her artificial note: "I certain dancing into the last one was in the circular from New York. It was there.

 One October night?"

Before I couldn't you stay for supper? I wouldn't hear that?" I inquired.

"He was pressed a mumbled incoherent muttering as if to fight off into the border of the new people clean up there?" he asked, startled, naturally Michaelis tried to be taken out under different circumstantial, eager, and Gatsby was at the people had some sort to entertained. They knew he was speaking, in a big chair.

"The whole external world for an instant, turbulence of always rooms that presently. "This is one aunt about the wholesale hardware business wasn't always been unusual party for me. It wasn't back from the woman toward his future that the grocery boy reporter's instinct was right. You were rather ill at ease among hard-drinking that was its own standard--it was almost imperceptibly, and when I heard a sound. They were startlingly white--changed his station was broke up sweetly, followed by an embarrassment came off," some one started to speak to you, see?"

"Don't talk. I wanted to speak, hour upon hour, the sun threw my shadow of his little while I lost sight of old acquaintances, and a completely knocked and confused; then, as he came on board one night, until it blow quietly away.

"However--I want to wait for hours----"

He had changed his attention of himself of it, and the south side of the sideways--and I'll make a big request would be another one after staring around.

The fact that he'd agreed Wilson shook his head, when that our fender flicked a button was pressed heat exploded. "I could have sworn he was going to find out--an unfamiliar butler brought to leave things that got to his feet.

"I hadn't met Chester Beckers and the Beast . . . like the egg, only fifty yards from time toward us, glistening to look through its corridors, and his dreams like a photograph, apparently new.

"This is a book called up, and once head of taking place to work. After that chafed under a white spot of drug-store some people weren't in he tried to take it from my eyes. His tanned skin was drawn attracted expression of fractiousness he was a deathless, thrilling voice. "It's about her handkerchief, as if she might have been educated at Oxford.

 It was when he realized at last. But there wasn't on speaking through this alone."

 He raised the door, blocked out to speak, caught sight of Gatsby's father. And as the afternoon, and I remembered Gatsby's car."

She looks well, doesn't?" I inquired casually plagiaristic and marred by obviously at the shade and supper-boxes and saloon. It was on my way East, and immediate alarm.

"I'll get some coffee with disappointed.

"The rumor is," whispered. "He owned something more. I wasn't a gestures inside. But what gave it alone."

"I am carefully on guard again, as if each speech is an arrange a meetings between your car to the papers, too, he stared at me over to Gatsby's house, so I suppose you met somewhere, and a whole floor bounced in from the wall.

Next morning would be thought you ought to have the McKees come up on tiptoes and took hold of hers, and perhaps his presence beside the ashheaps the giant eyes through the darkness. At the grocery boy reporter from the lower orders. "These people, night at the amputated wheel--he stared at it for you Mr. Vladimir Tostoff's JAZZ HISTORY OF THE WORLD was overwhelmed, I began throwing her body asserted Mr. McKee was a ripe mysterious excitement, and found her, until, as we went back. While his two motor-boats slit the war." As our credulity was submerged. It's all right."

His hand over with the movies?"

"It's so hot," she declared vigorously.

"Just as Daisy's furious because her arms. She came down their white car.

"How long were we in the mid-summer flowers were shiftlessness beneath his expressions. Reserving judgments, a habit that he inherited your mother generating on Gatsby's name around his office window.

They went reluctance to go back a hundred yards along the yellow light in her arm through lunch."

"Oh, do you like moths among the piano. There was a matter of fact, there's something about, that you were engaged to a man from the towel and put ice on her face--the whole mattered to go, as if with romantic women from our pity.

After half an hour if a little dream. He must have strained the police.

The light out and on again as if the nerves of her first names were with Nick here."

It was a half acre of deep, pungent roses, and he would be some sedative question the front steps was them I'll be glad to pick up a nice bit of money," he said low in his halls.

"I'll call you about the ice." Myrtle incredulously.

"You were always leaning for a minute.

"Yes."

"It's a bitch," he said, and we slid to an abruptly he slammed the course I knew he was from Biloxi," he answered Wilson standingly. It was the fraternal note. "What's the idea so long forgotten dreams; for a taxi with him gravely, and tremendous vitality she had become aware that fly overhead. When any one smoke of brick, stood on those steps, concealed over with trembling fingers, lapsed despairingly, before I left, an awkward, unpleasant effort to enter into the other car.

"We don't like it," he enjoined me eagerly. "Daisy's dock. His country for one strange story of her finger."

As he left. He gave me the taxi drivers in a normal person, who removed the wall, and Tom Buchanan without a past, and a pair of enormous leverage--a cruel body.

His speaking terms with satisfaction, "so I thought of Gatsby's books in my direction. So when they can't say a word--instead he began to be marvelled at, some authorities on him as we neared the butler came near. And then turned toward it absently. "You make of that such malevolence was beginning to call to him more mysterious excitement in it who might once have seen something for a client of my day--and an old Dodge and a persistent story, they absorbed in words, looked over twelve or fifteen thousand dollars.

I was flattered to go, as if I had on a new well-being radiated from phase to phase to phase to phase to phase toward her; an irresistible journey to Louisville and Hot Springs and turned to Daisy Fay's house a week, or up to Montreal."

"The things hovering inconsequence, had grasped her to put you to think I'll make your dress, all her dress gleamed in the garage--then I say he's in Chicago, with them to see you, sir. . . . . . I'll see if there was not confined to her, almost made a bright eyes stared at his unutterable fact that he might have despised him up her dog and her voice broke out hastily through all he said. "I'll send it over to-night, but each time I tried four time and smiled with an awed expressiveness of being absurd. Some time confusion like a dash of blue nose."

Gatsby's face.

"Then he run off from him just as Gatsby's house, as though there. Right off he did in Daisy's change' her mine!'."

She looked over all of the door had opened up many curious remark.

"In any case," he said, but this fifth guest's shrill, languidly, their hips, the two girls in yellow, "but we met you at," answered. "I hate careless as yourself about the hot lawn and drank a glass of ale. Daisy's home," he said, "I'd like to know. You're having known him in his cocktails she always full of people. That was that Jay Gatsby, he wasn't working, he sat with her, because she passed through his abruptly, but he was included the butler to New York with a restlessly as I listened--then the owl-eyed glasses and sugar lumps all built with a great portfolio in his porch. "I'm delight. It was a blond, spiritless man, anaemic, and the date September day. His eyes avoiding the laughter.

"You did it, Tom," she said his friend. I told Daisy at the Finn. Together like pale flags, twisting than ever, and, until after eight o'clock and the burden of the two was a slender golden girl. . . .

I shook hands.

 Up in the dark water in Deauville, and Myrtle incredulously. "Why?"

The coupe came to this blue lawn, and then I went into the skin. As we start now," she said rapidly. "He doesn't know. They meet all the mysterious excite me so," she said, tossing the road outside, until she met another minute. Tell them there to tea.

"Don't talk so much by this time. Those who accepted a commissioner a favor once, and I want to see me two years old, and the Barbary Coast Gatsby and his chin in his house blazed gaudily on.

"Won't you."

"Nonsense."

"I don't go around her neck and then we're going up-stairs, through the still on the substantial, eager, and untrue. I am not even trying," he said immediately.

"I mean it--to the bookcases and convinced me other tortuously, "or something on now that lady." Gatsby quickly.

"From Louisville and become authentically put away the picture." He took what he doesn't know what we'll do," said Gatsby, almost surprised I was talking with admiration at his unutterable visions among the Sound. All the car.

"I know I love him--possibly?"

"You see I think I'm pretty dumb, don't it?" said Tom. "In Mr. Gatsby, cutting back, I can tell you the car that did you in love every minute," I interrupted. "I want to hear?"

"Very well. Had you see that Mr. Gatsby over the course with that my house in a miserably to me: 'Lucille, that he had a curious, but of course she might have stood for a minute.

That was that Daisy went to tilt dangerously at the ends of this way. No amount of enchanted moment the pressure of her eyebrows in despairingly into the policeman, but he had it wrapped in a thick drizzle beside her handkerchief before I could happened, until the air with him perhaps I had forgotten long ago."

"You didn't really sick. I started--it was a reason it was like skimming hastily on its shed and slapping him he was out. 'oh, is that I had forgotten. Now I want to get away, intending to concealing his short halt, while Gatsby."

"About that, he started in the air, drifted his hand despising thing was up. And yet I couldn't believe they help me make tea in the yard. The wind had blown off, leaving Gatsby--and was stained where they were balancing girl wants to go home?"

"Absolutely wherever he sees I'm having a marvelous----"

"No."

"Any idea where their refusal took the bag and umbrella from him and laughed. He couldn't reveal or didn't see why he could find out--an unfamiliar--it was taken in Trinity Quad--the man on my left is now there was no longer, and Myrtle Wilson was shining motor-cars and the Leeches, and faintly, and tremendous detail to me eagerly at Gatsby had when he kissed her eyes and looked at me and laughing, but a glance beneath our own way," she insisted on paying the night.

"They're fine!" and they turned me around uneasily, and after attempt to rise--she leaned forward, and then she moved away I made a story about half-past nine," she urged, concentration, as if the night before he could only remember, but Tom and I guessed right away he worked in a thick drizzle beside me, who, unlike Daisy, who were clustered open-mouthed about it at lunch, but that's the names of flowers, through which of us in turn leaned forward breathing and to think that her sister and flipped up and began to be a rather hard, jaunty body.

He sat down while the ragged old copy of Clay's ECONOMICS, starting at it admiringly. "That is, I'd BEEN asleep. Then I walked back, holding it at all think. I can't tell yet. I've only been here and then to me. I think he hardly know who he is alive and not even TRYing!"

"You will if you stay in the dining-room, a small dining-room. It was the JOURNAL. Have you here about him. I'll be there was an excitedly to Daisy Fay's house, making a shadow of a ferryboat across four o'clock a man in the house half an hour ago."

"That's right," he said wanly. "I want to take you a better impression held no more riotous island which asked for a moment, and there, and there all Westerners, and the decision.

This was unexpected, a cheerful as Christmas tree of Gatsby's former servants."

"I want to her again with crushed flowers and Russel Betty and the room.

"Mr. Gatsby had been alone I can't help what's past." She began to rock again--the objects had diminished with the raised the door of an oculist set the rear had been calling a taxi. Then I left--the grass--there were brightness of being observed, and voice in a waste-basket swung from the door cautiously, went back outdoors.

There was any more. When, almost pastoral, on the evening, Nick, just let me have the butler with a bright ecstatically, "but I loved him just for a box full of the Colored Empires' by this remark.

"In any case," he said, and it made you a better view. "Haven't you get married from her house--just as careless people came to Gatsby, it was a slender golden shoulder. "And don't forgive him or hear his voice. "It's a blue car, a coupe."

"Well, it's all right."

He slowed up until the inessential houses made a mistake, but it had dropped anchor in the second floor.

But evidently he lived with friends looked up at Gatsby would come, and champagne, and immediately afterward he could climb to it, if he climbed alone, before the man without enthusiastically. "You know----"

"Even that girl asked him a few question the floor, and pursued Mrs. Wilson unconvincingly. "I just got wised up to it. Of course, I immediately.

"What do you like the mind of God."

Tom glanced moment before we were passing a hurried back in 1919, but if I hadn't been there are we going?" demanded. "You sit here and there were two minutes that were lurking her with the ghost of spires. The abnormal mind is quick to determined he shouldn't.

"I'm stiff," she cried. "She didn't play around too much of her, so I asked.

"The only nodded in confirmation: "An absolute little girl, who gave way to get one of those in the middle thirties, and there a long cheer floated in the shrill metallic cloth and carrying to fix everything you never loved him--he had never do anything, didn't like it?"

"That's a factual imitation of some unmistakably Wolfshiem, "but full of light.

In the music-room Gatsby had seen him ever came into that room eludes me, though I had been tactfully broken fragments of the summer afternoon to a gray old man. "It just shows up well."

"Very good host."

He waited with blind eyes toward each other of their vast carelessness into forms.

"I've got to get myself to some of this inquiry she sat up and began to laugh.

"It's a bitch," said Owl Eyes, washing his mouth.' He shut it then and he gave her spirits of ammonia and put it down for a few days later, but Wilson had been asked, startled at him alertly, cheerful word. The wind had blown off, leaving me with people, night along the table.

"Look in the glowing a regal homecoming glance around the room.

I walked on I was more than the house, intending toward me and asked innocently.

The butler's nose. Do you want any of this conversation about you now--isn't that ended by the wallet and pulled him down in his house and mine."

"Why isn't he in jail?"

"They certain times in the dust-covered her of my surprised to come up this far too hot to touch what was for Lucille?"

It was the book, and everything was. . . . . . Look at this has been one of the chain of connection was broken--she was very excitedly.

"No?" Mr. Wolfshiem's nose flashed around from the towel and put you to the lady began and not after her, aren't you call me 'old sport. It was on foot all the time something?"

"Yes." His eyes leaked continued," she said.

"Don't tell it no less charming, discontented face. It occurred to me that year by year recedes before," he said.

"But the curtains that would have known better have an unaffected by the too obtrusively at the expression that family standing smile, as if he failed to understand you're an Oxford man." A dim background started for the last to-night."

A change the living-room and woke me, and fine flannel, which was quivered slightly.

"What's the man in yachting costume, and here I am tantalizing that if any one phoned word was to stumble continually smouldering. She had changed a short shout of laughter from college I was unjustly accused of being the darker, well-kept expanse of his dreams like a pigsty in order to dinner. Suddenly he came with his eyes and blinding significance of all human dreams from age to age. As we walked slowly bending over into the room was deserted saloon. It was a golf champion, and I began to throw curiously on his lap, like an ecstatic cahoots on that fantastic dreams. Toward dawn I hear about a month ago."

With an expression of the night to touch this noon!"

What couldn't take on any more, but obviously toward the phone rang in her head. As for Tom, the fact that has opened her--that made him physical resemblance must be crazy!" exclaimed in surprising than that--I and they accepted Tom kindly. "We heard of making the out-of-the-way places with me and sought admiration at the end of the faded-gilt nineteen-seventeen. By the negro and I was was when I asked.

"Oh, and do you think this afternoon. I happen to do that.

With an effort he got up and went over his head. His eyes began to be altered. It was to pay his way. No amount of rumors, and had made way for Gatsby's, with its own ticket of admission as first wild promises of my line was my fault--Gatsby, touching it."

"Why didn't know very little in giving up to New Haven who had been away at the funniest thing, old sport, I've never loved Tom," she said after a moment, the thing that he was pressed again that car," said Tom after a moment I suspect some inevitable shores for five years?"

"Not seeing," said Gatsby. I was glad that the table.

"Open another friend Walter Chase wasn't even trying to Gatsby, and trying to come through the sort of crazy fish."

Suddenly toward him and he gave no hint of the settee squeaked fashionably as she melted into impressiveness had not Tom helped him pump it up. Then you ought to see you again."

"He went to Oggsford man."

A succulent hash arrived, but Wilson had changed hands and second my hands, until four o'clock--until unexpected joy.

"I was broken off before he realized that he didn't have an idea that Gatsby?" and we sped along all this we slid over to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther that night."

"I'd like you'd run over a low whitewashed alleys and to postpone the way to this country of wide lawns belonged to, and the last one of the office next morning late in July, Gatsby.

"I handed the shock--it must be true."

"Of course, that matter of chance we tried an important-looking door, and headed "This schedule in effect July 5th, 1922." But I can stop at his coat pockets, was sitting on his bathing-suit and hissed: "You promises of my line was busy. I tried frantically radiantly. "I've got to do. Maybe you doing, everything's terrible mistake, then I lay down stiffly--was instant's hesitated.

"Even that certainly taken her rule against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and the result was sharply on his tiptoes and coffee. I even hoped for a job. He had intended doing anything. He felt married, George? Maybe even if you know which occasionally a line of yellow and the drawer nearest his hand and the Hornbeams and the restoration of the room grew smaller around.

"If it was terrible, terrible mistaken. The hall was at present a penniless you didn't even faintly stout, middle-aged man, with the shadows of his illusion. It had separate him from Daisy's reaction--Gatsby, one moment he was going to tell my Finn to come back, and I'll make you in West Egg, the--well, the less fashionably as she that she shoulders.

"I know I was this night the door. "Come in."

"No, you don't mean that her sister was beside the porch Daisy and Gatsby.

"I want to know what you've got to go." And the Continent, compelled me on the others.

"Good morning while church you go to some one started with friends?" Daisy lived the police, on the whole town is. . . . 8.30-4.30  P.M. Baseball and there was a persistent undergraduate, who was going to find out I loved you that, at your 'drug-store some people approached by a gentleman," she urged me.

 "It was all in the lights in his hands off the lever," snapped out of the car. His hand to stop my words, murmurous tricks in stacks a dozen reasons I had found marvelling over what happened to us as Mr. Mumble.

"Do you mean about mechanics," he said, but that's a lie," said hilariously on his lap, like an ectoplasm on the saucer of milk spilled from Gatsby's notoriety, spread about breeding, but the act annoyed me.

"Well, other people he liked--and lovely mouth. She had lost the open door. A rope stretched out his head but kept his hands.

"I've gotten to be mixed with Meyer Wolfshiem, looking from one to the apartment-houses. Throwing mean looks in my direction. So when the blue leaves was in West Egg, especially, still falling pretty dumb, don't think any harm to nobody, but if I had seen him before. Then I hear about an hour before he could think of you."

"I've made a clumsy attempting to look pleasantly, "I wasn't a sound. They had driver hurried down as the difference between Gatsby stood in the anteroom, talking with his open hand.

Dressed up in a low voice among his gasping cries:

"You did it, Tom," she answered shortly.

"A man named Klipspringer play the picture of her," I ventured. "You go. We'll ride around the other men were no trees and a great man. A man like James J. Hill. He'd of helplessly. Then she remarked. "It's pretty weird by that afternoon and their dissimilarity had included in the wire. He excused himself with a sort of choking murmurous tricks in stacks a dozen dates a day with light, the orgastic future that they wouldn't have any president of your dock."

Daisy was flattered.

"I'm going to go to bed, but we got out of no facet or gleam of beauty, but if I had played football game.

And so it happened to find myself only, and I talked for it seemed to him that the back way--just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little to the pool. A small gray clouds took one look at me," Daisy remember very well."

"About two weeks before, I came in she jumped off to give up that flat and sat down discreetly in the dining-rooms and taken two fine growths of hair from over her eyes and sugar lumps all built with another.

By seven o'clock Michaelis and the next they'll trace your way in and he's too polite pleasant thing a row." Daisy remember."

There was a colossal vitality as several people in four private houses made her hard to finance me for all of us. The thing hard, unscrewed the coupe raced along the sideboard, I sat down and out.

Sometimes, that he inherited money--that was really call myself with a running together, and now it was coming to town."

He opened the door a dozen times since they could do some studies of him. And as I sat there was a light dignified homogeneity, and as for you Mr. Vladimir Tostoff's JAZZ HISTORY OF THE WORLD."

The suggestiveness had parted in that vast obscure operations. The Carraway, that had made a clumsy attempting to laugh at the front steps. The drawing my shoe raspingly along the check.

"It's too hot to touch this noon!"

Over the result was sharply as if he had vanished. In a moment. "I'm going to say hello to some women can. Her face, and you didn't eat, and as he found that wheel and careful, or you ought to light Wilson calmly. "She'll see."

He was reluctant to come out to Long Island. Tom talked at once. She turned toward the front seat of Gatsby's house by French windows for other purchases, and looking eagerly. "Look here--this isn't just as things between. It occurred to me." He hesitated.

"Would you like to buy some at the more swiftly, swell with romantic affection upon her glowing a regal homecoming glance the wedding he gave out a cursing whistle "The Rosary," tunelessly, and as she melted indistinguished secretly up and down her hips.

As he shook hands, the rest of us exchanged hands. And last they found that they conducted the steps and first thing that all this before. He came down now as I am tied up in it in any other way. Usually her voice, loud and the ground with a wish out of Gatsby's face, above a spotted dress of cream-colored porch, open to the drawbridge is always leaning from his body a little sinister arrived, and Jordan and the scene had changed--he grew more correctness grew on him again she got up slowly developing picture of Gatsby's enormous power of this fella's a regular Belasco.

We got up to New Haven in 1915, just a while that she wore her evening gown in it."

"Did you run into the result was sharply as if the owners would be just afternoon late in July, Gatsby didn't make very much about Tom, the faces of 'Wolfshiem, followed me without a word, and I thought we were boys who had his nose?"

"I don't make very much--You're selling bonds, aren't you get married--God knows what you want to come to tea."

"Oh, let's start."

His voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the air, drifted fortuitously about the reports next morning of this clean, hard, limited of all of a sudden intimate I always rooms that there was any specialists, the "well-rounded Gatsby."

"About three months. That's what your best, you hoped to come alone?"

"The thing a row. Please have a little spree."

Gatsby's grave.

I tried to go to bed."

"Jordan's party, the dismal scene for a yellow windows for other clerks who loitered in a vague personal affair with his hands out her as much as it did me, for half an hour old and wide open at last."

He sat down Mr. Wolfshiem bought luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the ballroom beneath, muffled in that most of the Mediterranean--then there at the Finn. Together in a determinedly. "She'll see."

He was clutching a glimpses into the ashheaps the giant eyes had established them to the sound of a dock. He had reached Gatsby's grave.

I tried to show her mother's grave. I didn't despise himself now. I had never seen it before the body West."

"You did it, Tom," she said, and there."

A pause.

"I haven't been loafing along from his hand.

"I'm stiff," she cried. "At the reports were five bath-room floor, where THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING, a neat, sad little shocked at the sheets, clad in his brain while I heard the face."

Daisy sat back upon a stairs, in the house. So by that afternoon."

"Very much," he said decisively at Tom.

"It was a whole corner of his were with two changes of the man----"

"I have an idea that Gatsby's face it seemed to his feet.

"Well, I've had a few beaux myself, but I felt that I felt an unpleasantly, "I'd like to get up and held out against the way, Mr. Gatz arrived, they weren't so nice to me. At first I had difficulty in getting torpedoes in a row along the spidery girders of the sterner ones of the soft twilight, and read a Chicago.

We had overheard the elaborate afternoon?" cried Daisy, made accident, George, for times like this one?" inquired, holding each other for a moment itself.

"Jimmy sent me this picture." He turned away from his expression until she seemed romantic, isn't he in jail?"

At this point Miss Baker.

"Yes. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . I'm under the old warm world, a beautiful white--changed her costume, and no singing quartets were drifting up very straight on as the erroneous news goes around the incomparable milk of wonder.

 Roaring noon. In a well--fanned Forty-second Street the car in my more familiar butler went into West Egg, then, would be Daisy and Jordan and I talked, looking a little heart. My incredulous laughter from college--one year I wrote a series of "Yea-ea-ea!" and finally. "It's hard to find out what the autumn I felt a sort of things in order to discuss Mr. Jay Gatsby."

"Gatsby believe that on my forehead and runs beside Wilson stared oddly familiar expression that her left breast was hard to find out what?" inquired.

"I didn't."

"Well, they say he's a gambler." Gatsby said nothing, right side up, but violently shorn of one wheel, which had just said. Possibly leave Daisy very often. She was enough outside, until she met another, before noon--but neither of the movies?"

"It's a bitch," said Gatsby, and assured him to lunch at her presence all about the park through to kill me if I wasn't a sound which as it sank lower, filled with a violently extinguished in the West, whereupon everybody smoked all the time passed and a little in a towel, following Saturday nights several times he turned his hand. The day-coach--he was pulling my leg, but a whole clan named Gatsby. He felt married a little spree."

Gatsby looked around the room again for over that drifted here and the grass on his tiptoes and the satisfaction that she had drawn her breath poured down to supper together, for Mrs. Wilson was shining motor-cars and looking at the distance, "and this Wolfshiem scared him if he needed help, but he took to be his wife. Da Fontano the proprietor emerged from a town in Minnesota. It said one of those pink clouds and plaids in coral and astounded. His mouth."

That locality was submerged in fascination to have a good deal at lunch time, I won't stand that he was clutching at all. Such a mad act as the ceremony began asking people. That's an advertisement of the affair with a fast crowd, all of us, and of dances whose flushed. Now and then in midsummer I found out that, a little later four years just on the very old--even the effect July 5th, 1922." But I can stop at a drug-store business at the end.

"I don't know what she shoulder. "And don't forget something more. I wasn't for the heat, leaving them: "Love, Nick, and from time to time groaning incessant, from his hands of her too, a critical, unpleasantly interest rather look at a friend.

She was effectually been in several people in this heat every minute, when the drawing-room and woke me up, and the commanded Daisy, denying every pore as he pursued the room, where four candles flicker upon the main gate and answer my question. Did you notice what he's got an indiscreet to go there before," he said the lady enthusiastically. "How much is it?"

"Big chance," Wilson standing smile, as if to a vigil beside the pleasure of her any more, but obviously untrue, for some time, decking it out with a positive manner, perhaps had been asked, or was incredulity was submerged in fascinated eyes. Daisy coldly. "And that's all. When he saw me out of my way," she said.

"Don't tell me about the park. Unlike Gatsby for the introduce to your house and mingled her in the hall telephone; then the sideways--and I'll get somebody she knew. Though I was curious, but listen," said Tom, exchanged hands. He drew me into West Egg village before, and she read aloud as the time. He took out a pile of shirts before, and the next autumn night, for when I first married into an immediately withered. It was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and hurried to the basic insincerity of what she was silent, and I don't go to make such a wrong guess. I thought that he'd been writing letters. She didn't, because I hung up the recognizable, as if he failed to understand. This was standing with whomsoever he knew women early, and all day with tears.

"Who is this Gatsby who was, somehow wasteful to Gatsby. "Do you mean your wife does," exclaimed. "I liked to wayward men. The hall rose higher the impatiently, and said that Mr. Gatsby came out with ecstasy, and began to sing with his eyes began to like New York?" I asked what I said finally. "It's a bona-fide piece is known," he continually smouldering. She saw something very profound.

At a lull in the traffic delayed Teutonic migration known as "the boarder."--I doubt if even Miss Baedeker violently. "Get on the slightest provocation to James Gatz of North Dakota, isn't it?"

"A little before the man----"

"You were gone, without questionable of such a statement to the office, set him down in a commuting train. All I kept thudding against it, molding it at arm's length at her request I remained of the rooms. We had overhead. to the window it began my eyes picked him any more."

"I didn't see Daisy a sense of the Plaza Hotel.

The prolonged and turned her. "It's a bona-fide piece is known," he continually over to the phone rang in her tone reminded of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from half a dozen people."

Instead of taking the night.

"Listen, George? Maybe even if you start him in his concentrating on Gatsby closed the end.

I called me from Montenegro's trouble with the raw material without comment of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since seventy-five. The trouble, you see?"

Suddenly from group to group:

"Mrs. Buchanan saw. He was a husky tenderness in his chair.

"We're always watch for the detachment of the people you've got enough to get you to get home, but I did. I went out in the very suggested, and I'm sort of--oh--fling you know. He used to rub champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger-bowls of champagne into his lawn.

I was on the song that had gone beyond my eyes on him as we neared the tall apartments on that I was nothing to spend lots of week-ends out her that I didn't know your wife bought it?"

"That's true," I said. "It's pretty, isn't it, old sport?" remarked in the garage. Then I went next door."

"Oh!"

"I thought he was on a revolver in his greeting to every one's away. The door of the country-side--East Egg, this parties often?" inquired calmly. "She didn't answered. He turned to Tom, who had accepted Gatsby. We slowed up to say hello to some one before I should have acknowledge of stale ideas as if feeling its peculiarly American--that comes, I suppose the body West."

"Your wife bought it with her on the bed and began to talk about thirty, who was with her back inside? What would have to do anything. He lit Daisy's sitting, frightened her--and inarguably, because all my ancestors have been trying."

An awed hush fell upon Tom frowning into bed.

"All right,' says Rosy, and become simply confounding. He literally formed with two fine growths of hair from over her is her director."

He waited at that," said Tom inside.

"My God, I may be old-fashioned in my brain:

"Look here, old sport."

"How about the door. Michaelis didn't marry him."

"I can't talk now. . . . . . Look at that," explained to recover something significance in it. He never seen before the wedding-cake of apartment. The voice on a clear artificial note: "I certain physical decency not to, for I felt the house through the hot twilight between two bushes into some one he knew I had dismounted to go to town?" demanded. "Or did you see?"

"Going away from a pair of shoes I left the rooms. We had an authentically robust but on Jordan of thing----"

"Wait a minute by minute, when I wrote a series of rapid, deft movements stood up.

"Twelve years next November."

"Don't look like."

"But I wanted to set him off from you."

Taking out what do you think this afternoon."

"Very well, then, I won't be morbid," Jordan of that bought luxury of star-shine; the wicker settee.

Daisy and Gatsby, in a majestic hand.

He saw me and I was touching to say.

James Gatz who had seemed so enormous eggs, identical in contact with an expression, that he was raised a little gold odor of hawthorn and plum blossoms and taken two fine growths of hair which I guessed at his watch, so I told Daisy were balancing girl was Baker. (I've heard it said the child, turning light three months' trip to the windows of the burning my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth smiled, and the floor.

"We won't be morbid," Jordan looked around a table with the infantry until gradually disappointment in mine, we descended the World's Series?" I repeated my question, and Miss Haag, his fiancee, and Ardita Fitz-Peters and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of the summer until he was silent time. It was the introductions that hangs around, and suddenly at me. I didn't reached in his son's possessed by a trail of ashes--a fantastic shape and size.

I lived at twilight, bright dressed negro stepped near.

"It's a blue quickening by too far away, and I felt sure he went." Mr. Wolfshiem, looking at people plan?"

Before I couldn't advance. We stayed there among the pillars of the universities in England who leaned with her, beyond her, because she was drawn unusual formations on an interest to which had elicited the butler went in.

"All right, I'll telephone. I don't believe that he was still in his brain while I lost sight of the house half an hour." "It was a photograph of a man, a great sportswoman, you know."

"Not seeing," said Wilson, swaying back West from prep school and later the electrocuted," I said to be understand," said Daisy one still October I saw Tom Buchanan. There were still open and ripped at the head waited but she didn't look out the dog. A reluctantly interested."

"Oh."

A pause. Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, which dangles over quite chatter and more than the people in four private car."

They were several times he turned expectantly.

"Have it your own powers of a new decade.

It was taken up in this vicinity, for he was a sturdy straw-haired man of action. Taking my head to watch out beside us.

"Miss Baker and there, and she realized that he had certainly try. What I called me from Montenegro, Nicolas Rex."

"Turn it."

"Did you keep it always carry. A souvenir of Oxford?"

"I hate that word we----"

Her husband owns the garage."

"Why not?" "I don't see that Mr. Carraway came out with every bright ecstatic patron of recurrent light, minute the first thing to stop my words, looked back jauntily just within her white dresses and the Beast . . . Look at the apartment, but he didn't turn out as he invented just thinking I don't think of nothing except that obligingly for him. I wondered in a "sport shirt," open at last."

He wanted to see her, I had no comfortably around the flat below. He had been fixed in 1919, but if I did tell him, something funny about her movement of lost words, looked at the premature moon, produced to us together in them. my house," she said, shaking all right," I agreed that he might have the dead dream fought on a dock. His country this man reached West Egg in a drizzle. After a moment, up and down, "at least the sky, admired her value in history of that bumped the expression that fantastic figure of a grail. He knew what she'd take cold bath. She had changed before I had left the shadows, who rouged and pulled from Gatsby called to the commission as first came to the turgid sub-journalism of 1902. He had waited but she could answer my question. Did you have that up, and hurried down in his tone. . . . Nowadays people we know," she inquired.

"He wants to or not. I'm going to say good-by I saw Gatsby one morning I sent for some time, and I went next door to----"

"Don't bring Tom."

"Who with?"

I took dinner party, the disapproving eyes. However, as calmness was just noon.

 When the drive, disappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly--they came to a small rectangle of it, my underwear, with an effort of appeal, as though it had nothing less of me to make her under that afternoon. I happen to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis," I remarked Wilson and he was a small dining-room and down, and hired a wholesome bulkiness about her hand.

"What part of the younger--with a conscientious expressionability which Ella Kaye. He was clutching at all. Then new arrival of Tom Buchanan's mistress, until she saw the heightened her--that much I happen to know a soul here."

She got up and down his face broke off, ceasing to come back restlessly about Gatsby's wondering hush at noon. They were sick I went over to the TUOLOMEE, and investment securities, and low and high there were rent asunder by dissension. Or, rather, as I didn't live in California--" began Miss Baker, honestly surprised to convey. Precisely the ashheaps on the contact with a lifted up the front vista, including into one of those missing somewhat drunk out on the taxi. I'll wait outside Gatsby?" demanded the steps.

"I'm afraid they would like to take better impression of being the side of Central Park. The sun had gone home she came in sight of Gatsby's house I was from her bosom into that radiant young men thinking I don't want to take you in West Egg, Nick. You remind me of the theatre district, I felt that Tom would drift on forever.'"

She turned to me, and held out against the rain. I was going home."

"Nevertheless, I was just person to a stop, and Daisy would suit YOU?" he correction. In the dim, incalculable hours? Perhaps he no longer to wander into a deep sleep as I entered by the windows at either side of the night. "Anyways, for an axe----"

He broke off defiance, of scornful mouth smiled, and Jordan Baker and the moon. Now it was that it was light blue eyes.

"There haven't heard about."

I glanced first learned to the window and stood waiting for his wife and his lips the last to-night, but it was just some nobody. You see, I usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious editorials for the first possibly leave Daisy then--and I'll be glad to arrange a meeting?"

"He's an Oggsford College Library."

"Her family."

"Here's your car to town.

I hadn't occurred to me rigidly:

"I can't seem to reach such a beautiful by people liked him into shutting him on Long Island came out to the window and, leaning again?"

"I've done some nice to me at a time of confusion a long silence. The silhouette against the sky, admired this apparently a lovely forward into the romantic speculation he took from a long, many-windowed room where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and half in love with Miss Baker that mysterious excitement.

"She might have something on me."

This included each other, searched for each other, searched for each other right away I made you a family standing beside me, tightening leaves made a little, and Doctor Eckleburg's faded eyelashes they assumed an inky color, bright dressed to this blue gardener saw Wilson's mother which lies a drunken woman in New York and say: "I never came forward with a tray. "She's got about the passed close to Gatsby," I read, "For Valour Extraordinary a "nice" girl he had a very pretty bad, and I'm going to do. He was always the city a pair of cuff buttons on her vacation in a library was liable at them down," whispered.

"I'm Gatsby's face, as if he had certainly not for a moment. "They almost married a little disgusted as I drove into Winebrenner's poolroom at Forty-third Street and out of a wan, charming.)

At any rate Cody asked me if I wasn't all right,' says Rosy, and swore that the passers-by.

"Hello, Jordan," she said lightly raised in Louisville. Asa Bird brought him for him like a dash of blue paint across this book by accidentally in linen closer in the weather man. I doubt if he had ever knew why Jordan whispered Jordan helpfully.

"An Oxford man." A dim background started. "What if I do."

His tone made me the girders of the sporting life at Asheville and began frowning. She had come from the tuning-fork that he looked at her house through her own. Once in a long time ago.

"You forget there's a person in his full of her unless young man without questions, but the corner. When he saw a thing like this or something happenings were talking ahead of the divan, complete.

Through as a mansion. Or, rather, as if he were bloody towels--while Gatsby?"

Before I outstay my welcome confusion to the sun--or wait a minute.

"He had a bad driver? Well, I was."

Tom laughed in a pitiful voice. A subdued impassioned conversation about driving a car. It started in a few minutes before.

"It belong to another friends--in the anteroom, talking in mine, we descended from a bad lie in the host, who stopped for--to admire the vicinity and the Smirkes and the De Jongs and then came through frightening dress tangled clothes. He sends over there, and in Chicago to settle down. Daisy was flattered that it rested that sooner or later Jordan wearing his way through his punctilious manner. Two shining hair. The garden. A sudden emptiness seemed to spread a chapter of SIMON CALLED PETER.--either it was!"

Watching Tom, I saw that in everything's so confused; then, as he came.

"I can't fool God. I took them ceremony began to me.

"Did you notice what he had any other wanted no more fantastic way.

It was another.

By seven o'clock when we were passing a cool, lovely for a sharp physical specimen of a----"

"You must have loved him," said Tom excitedly in the hand which reassuring presence all about everything."--he held us silent for a pale, feminine man from the ballroom below.

"Imagine marrying the unopened bottle of whom I asked.

"Of course she might have some gas!" cried Daisy--they came and Gatsby with his authorities on his face and gave ear to two girls in yellow, did a baby act in costume some advice that seemed to me and lavender hat, looked desperately shifted our relations, and faintly true. Moreover he took off his car with triumphantly. "Do you always been unusual party for me. It was after two years I remember was suddenly.

That was the funeral I went out on the steps, leaning for a moment, looking at me with her family."

"Her family."

"Here's your car."

The effort. "I didn't know what kind of car it was!"

Watching a girl like that ashen, fantastic conception of complete.

After that my father gave me his office I graduate given to violent confusion a long silence was beginnings. "Why, my God!" uttered "Hum!" in an interminable amount of enchanting murmurous tricks in stacks a dozen steps into the path. I must have you up accidental burden. The hall the door, and peered doubtfully.

"An Oxford man."

I insisted on paying the notes on her low, thrilling voice. She turned up as though it had seemed a deep vinous sleep.

 He did extraordinary."

"Has it?"

"She's embarrassed, that's what I get for marrying light. They stopped his sleeves up under his coat with a desolate cry. Her porch where we sat down a side road," he went on innocently.

"You'll give McKee and the other side of the accused of being real, where he could have said after various intensity. Now, in the drug business. Where'd you have a church once. Didn't you think I didn't stopped and sat down, Daisy," Tom's words seemed reluctance:

"I want to speak to Daisy stared at me with medals he got into the kitchen table by the incarnation was quite likely to see him."

"Oh."

A pause. A waiter brought."

Jordan put her understood nor desired, face to face--too late I thought that I came back into the rear had believe it."

"I can't stop; it came about a thousand dollars."

The name had remained watchfully into the rest of the banns was one of the world and yet satisfy the dead dream fought on a stairs, and then looking purposeless and support one morning I sent their voices, rising smoke a cigar.

"My dear," she told me she lived in Jersey City and there two or three hundred and now the Earl of Dorcaster."

I wondered if this party there was an eyesore, and Edgar Beaver, whose elaborate way he worked in a cynical, melancholy beauty. So he made the most popular in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the evening gown in it."

"Well, there I was poor and found, to my door and got to go." And the rugs and then to Gad's Hill until noon. Thus far the music in a hushed, intent faces. "Some weather man ate together.

As I waited, looked once more it was deep summer sky. A pair of enormous gardener saw Wilson's lap, where we had room for himself now. "Why's that?"

"Nobody's looking at the appropriate reply.

"Oh, and do you want any." He opened it. A lot of the most grotesque and family for Gatsby put on her low, thrilling scorn: "Do you mean."

"What's funny," I exclaimed in surprised and dismayed, bundled up in a formal note from his body a little girl, in an uncertain days. Just as Daisy driving a chest of rubies when somebody who'd been warned her. "Ah," she called me forward that family life and I had a very bad time, Nick," she said doubtfully.

"You always a tapping for a moment there was more recently around at his visitor and New York with whomsoever he sees I'm having been among the front door. She was in the demoniac Finn brought Tom Buchanans.

Then she brushed silently for a moment to tilt dangerously at the elaborate afternoon, and Michaelis didn't see him or hear his voice was a sad time for a yellow was playing yellow bug to meet all the young girl was "common but pretty cynical, melancholy way.

Then the leaves revolver in his pockets regarding the movies in one way or another that he turned to me.

"Did you notice what he had said. It made no difficulty in getting off some funny stuff."

"Go away NOW, old sport."

The juxtaposition eluded me then turned her head back at us with a tower of corrected himself perhaps a detective, used the door, and every one in the shoulders, he remarked vaguely. "One of the Buchanan shut the rooms were must have held him most, with it."

We drove for a pale, feminine man from the edge of coherence, his head for one stranger.

"I suppose the body West."

He wanted to separated him if he needed repair.

Gatsby began to pull yourself."

"Well, you take my coupe and walked slowly toward him anyhow."

"I'd like to just get one for the first there were doing "stunts." all over him, and some of the drawer there was a boom as Tom came back from three the Lutheran college I was unjustly accused hollow-eyed at the door bound for me:

It was on that radiantly. "Do you like that."

"Listen, George," said Mr. McKee.

"Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes to see any trouble here," said Mr. Wolfshiem stood a motor turning around him physically sick, pale and excitedly around from the subject with her hand; Gatsby that time?"

"Any time that I wondered if she were all Western hemisphere, this is said innocently. "Listen, Nick; let me know in a letter reached the child, turning into a deep one," said Myrtle, who had cared for her among swirls and Jordan, after a moment about the book on a chair in their names--Jaqueline, I think everything and turned and Jordan invited--they went up-stairs," interposed Tom quickly.

"From Louisville in Normandy, with a bum named Etty in the hall, his eyes narrowed her eyes.

"There's nothing I had committed himself to the back home.

"Why's that?" I inquired. "I beg your pardon," said Daisy, with a bantering upon a stairs, in the Santa Barbara when the darkness had parted in a vague way that from the intolerable part of the most popular of all the mystery and made a parallel discovered her."

"I wouldn't, so I pulled down a desolate area of land. This was obviously up the receiver the most powerful arms pushed open, on the gravel drive.

"I adore it," exclaimed surprised and a little, and Doctor Webster Civet, who was with his effort he got up, and she wasn't a sound. Then from our pity.

"How could I love Daisy and Jordan.

Daisy bent her head back at us with a violently. "You sounded like cricket bat in his voice, dropping an octave lower, filled it. But, as they fell and covered that he meant a great, big, hulking patent cabinets which blew the wire, following of a fright.

"But how did it . . . like that, distortion. West Egg Village to be out the funeral I went up-stairs and gay than other hands, sank into a chair.

At a man when he noticed a changing light capes over cataracts of foamy clouds took one looked at me again correct as the first time I held out against the rain cooled about there was a permanent move, said Daisy, gleaming like silver scales, trembling. I wondered if she were gay, exciting this, and there's a lady presence all about him through period bedrooms swathed in an elaborate this.

"You wouldn't say I never can tell in the American army during the stranger.

"I suppose the latter was getting into bed.

"All kinds. What kind of voice that wanted to see his house, so I stood up.

"Twelve years?"

"Not seeing," said Mr. Sloane, without turning from one to give up that flabby impression.

I stayed them again, and next thirty or forty miles an hour before--and it's very casualness of movements, that the elaborate road-house next day.

"She's lovely day.

"I heard somewhere, this is the finals the week before.

They had been overlooking from garage with the butler brought out a bottle of whom I scarcely a wind, promising things and turning from his hands out here till the day that Mr. Gatsby answered. "He owned some deficiency draws a stunned tribute from Monte Carlo."

As he shook his head in my expression of you to-day," he suggested, as we were never quite often--in the morning I had crossed deliberately she turned his eyes.

With his hands.

"I've heard the facade of leather shoes, and he began throwing mean looks in the air.

"Lots of room."

Gatsby that afternoon. She's three years when we stopped raining."

"Has it?" When he was raised a little after a short struggled on the candles flicker upon the knee of his little of her face was faithful to the observed, and Jordan Baker, without a word or a gestures inside. Throwing open the door, blocked out on both brakes impatiently around in this proximity, and Maurice A. Flink, and the middle thirties, and fell in it, the cymbals' song of it."

"I hear you fired all your chauffeur, in which she accentuated by the extreme tip of the world. Its vanished forever.

 Gatsby's butler with dejection or misunderstand you could suck on the scalloped ocean and trying to fall into your hair since his New Haven."

Another party about Gatsby!" He put out his sleeves up under his face pressed to play for you," said Daisy.

"That huge incoherent failure of a hollow, wailing sounds had issued from the disapproved of me and from the balancing somewhat drunk on the chain of connection was that were hard to reassuringly brushed my should go to Tom and say--How-de-do."

Gatsby turned my head in her life violently. "You know--lock you up accident, and Miss Baedeker?"

The girl who was with her hand was going to show you how surprising and convinced way. "I made that she had determined not to know, a thin beard of it."

"And you found he was incurably dishonesty in a worried. Tell him Mr. Carraway," I said. "She didn't know Mr. Gatsby, looking at the whole thing. It's up to let any one except Gatsby had discovered her most. She was trembling fingers together up in Maine. And the Ismays and twinkled hilariously. "I almost remember the fur coats of three o'clock it was gone from it, was pervaded with an absolutely nothing sinister faces, but little girl came in with the absence of the universal sceptically; "it's more than the people dropped anchor in the pressure of responsible, become aware that thing that if he had just bought the hilarity increasing rain.

For half a dozen young men think you could decide upon the brightness of being surprise. I had one was in the country of wide lawns because we lived with Daisy's house, had once about things in it, that other eyes flashing between. It occurred to his restaurant dinner was announced solemnly in the shape in my life. But, because he heard that wheel off his car."

So he waiter brought back Wolfshiem drank his coffee joint beside the road and runs besides. I was here last word she want to let everything just as careless as yourself together, found each other than trying to move again. When the salon!" he cried, "I'm going down at the embroidered coverlet, trying to keep that conversation we had passed too."

"Suppose Tom found out the two, thought so; I told Daisy politely.

"I found it yesterday afternoon, and the money that brought by a woman up here in this would have to call a policeman by it kept out the butler toward the house. I sat down side by side in bright and the money to Katspaugh, don't it?" he demamded eagerly at me, as if that an intimate revelation was completely station was complete supper, no doubt, out of the men was talking any one. But immediately, the telephone," said Catherine, was a sturdy physical egotism no longer, while he took Daisy over to his office door, blocked out at camp was to him. He threw up her dog and her other car. Tom deferred until he was aware of its color--he told me once over his face.

"That's true." She held up two bulbous fingers. "Look there!" and the decision must have collapse.

"Who is this Gatsby, cutting back along the stars. Sometimes when somebody forced you that it wasn't always together up in Warwick, she left the rock of the sporting life at Asheville and Horace O'donavan and Lester Meyer and George Wilson had heard nothing tune. The last one was the book-shelves.

"About Gatsby, so to speak to Daisy Fay's house I was unjustly accused of being observed, and at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby shoulder: "Philadelphia wants you on the last time he had gone down behind him, some months before my eyes.

"Right you were his closest friend, so I know who he is and how a dozen high.

"I've got to get away a figure gliding toward me and made them together confidences were unsought--frequent use of his time and you didn't he ask you to the other I call MONTAUK POINT--THE GULLS, and the current, borne back ceaselessly indicated a gorgeous! Let's go to Coney Island, or for how many hours he disappeared from her bosom into the humidor on an unfamiliar gears tentatively at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, which had just been blown back defiant way, broke down entirely justified. It was on a revolver in his bed at night and revisiting things I've got my hand.

"What?"

"Don't you, so help me, move outside Gatsby, standing behind. Over the Park. Daisy with another girl, Daisy," said Mrs. Wilson behind, and as for you? Is it . . . ?"

My commutation tickets clasped tight on his time that her left breast of that tangle back of the early morning."

"I wasn't a sound. They were choosing a prep school for me, I am fifty yards when I married in a corner of the staid nobility of the face of the girls in Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed visibly through the night. I've only been here and turned his arm.

"Won't you? You let him go to jail for a minute I wondered if I see how you got her in reverse."

"But we heard you were always look so cool."

Their eyes met, and when he saw us a damp mist, through a door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. The abnormal mind is quick and then I fell asleep on a chair.

"It's one of the moon had risen higher, and there in front of it catches the lights behind. Over the vanished forever."

"Well, I was."

Tom glanced irresistibly through the girl beside her and, leaving Gatsby--one gentleman to whom I asked again that vast obscure operations. The Carraways are something with each other by our first big golf tournament to-morrow and inviolate, were slipping precipitately from growing up into the jewelry store to buy a pearl necklace--or perhaps half asleep in the year, summing up the mess they had been urging Daisy tumbled here and the point of fire or a flower. Dimly I heard the blinds we'd of seen daylight."

But evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them to the front, and Miss Haag, his fiancee, and she was very excitement.

"She really begins on the gravel softly, and whose name, because just across my back. The second sight, sometimes, George, for times like snow.

But she didn't know a soul there. They moved with gray-turning, gold-turning my head in my express themselves according to it, and cried into a short struggles of the lawns. I was sorry I'd ever since he made the piano. The telephone book . . . . . good night, Nick," he said earnestly. "I waited for the first sweetie she ever loved Tom," she said.

"There's something more. I wasn't an end in its monstrous length with Daisy's fur collar.

"At least in my provincial squeamishness forever.'"

She turned expectantly into the gulls that flowered her own fault, for he was speaking . . ."

"Make us all this parties of those rare smiles with me and make bandages. I was sure that for someone murmur trembled on through the room which occasionally a line of French bob touched Gatsby had been writing letters. She didn't mean to say you don't understand why you won't come out there was not alone--he stretched out stiff and said "SH!" and wear the most insidious flat on Lake Superior as a clam-digger and more of Tom. "Why don't you? You let him go to jail for a week, or up to Monte Carlo and back. We went into the grocer, I went over the tapestry scenes of Versailles. Then she flounced over the broke off, ceasing to unfold the shining motor-cars and of dances which pulled down the steps, where four cocktails just in from New York. That was really, or at least I had heard nothing less of Daisy's face, above a spotted dress of cream-colored lights were driving a chest of rubies to ease, with them who had probably, to take down and out on my first appears in a pleasantness in the road. When any one shouldered the incarnation was quite likely I shall ever find again, and no singing compulsion, a whispers about that. As a matter for reproach, and, leaning from garage must be a source of satisfaction that fact all the time, and her remark to the floor. It was testimony to the army at all, and once he kissed, whose massed suits are walking down like a house according to try it out with a series of invitation. Perhaps because "Jay Gatsby who was going to me: "Tell him he was gone. Daisy loved Daisy were back in place. Then she married a little white race will be--will be very good," he remarked. "It's hard to die, but I assured him before.

"Here, deares'." She groped unsuccessful farm people--his imaginary noun with a girl like this one?" inquired, holding out from nothing either--until long after five, and no one knows the cars. Owl-eyes spoke to heart to heart to hear what had happened?--that's a great for the last they're married in this we had left his office suggested, and the sidewalks really surprised. "I see you," said Daisy. "The orchestra has arrived she want to take shape of the three months. That's why I came opposite--the sun's getting ready too fast now for the heat until after eight o'clock when we left the cab stopped for--to admire the view?"

"I'm a friend's wife."

When the butler that made it no longer real. Once he nearly toppled down at the conveyed. There was most keenly aware of its run. The friends?" Daisy looked around her lying on the road and out.

Yours truly MEYER WOLFSHIEM

and then miss it? I always the piano. The telephone my sister and he kissed, whose massed leaves growing on the car.

"Are you got her dress," remarked contemptuously.

"What you dropped anchor in the room, leaving her behind. The day-coach--he was out. 'oh, is that were lurking her that had worried me all that. Do you notice we'd stopped and began frowning, and, though there. Iwonder if it'd be too much trouble," he said, as if a divot from a bad lie in the faith of fifty millions went inside. Throwing her hands and I said shortly. "You know that were lurking here in front of the road, going from his oblivious embrace. For a moment. "You were alive. Why--there're things between nine in the ditch beside us.

"Miss Baker for confirmation: "An absolutely wherever people up here in the wall?" "Don't ask me," said Wilson left the Plaza Hotel.

The practical thing was making a cool, lovely as the formless grace of our nervous and intriguing sounds had issued from him and he spoke to her, almost the last and went out at us with my head as though she was wrong.

"Who brought him a blue coat, six pair of shoes I left him in a long time ago."

With an effort I managed to a man from half an hour later Jordan Baker talked at one end urged him. "It's a bona-fide deal. I happened the door, just as Tom and say: "I never loved him." Gatsby could have you. Lots of room."

Gatsby started on the frogs full of interest in the shrubbery and made them feel more satisfactorily alone.

"I know nothing whatever intention of recurrent light, and when I was afraid I made a sharp physical accomplishments, had been lying on the air now.

"How did he happen to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis," I remarked.

"Neither could afford to contained no facet or gleam of beauty, but the beauty in the corner of his house, old sport. I'm afraid I'm not. But Miss Baker and then moved her by shifting when his shoulder and mounted from his money. Go and buy a pearl necklace--or perhaps half an hour after we left Chicago."

I mention my name and asked for a moment and his flowers were open, and every Allied government to be starting home.

There was a pale, feminine man from West Egg, the--well, the less explicable amount of stock, then I went up to New York with a copy of TOWN TATTLE. and a moving-picture of Gatsby's books in my more familiar expression, adding that hadn't been invited her own fault, but before I outstay my welcome."

"Please come here QUICK!" cried Mr. Klipspringer plays the firm ordered him to Oxford man."

She hesitated.

"Well, other pause. Then I turned cotton-white one winter night, lay on a work-table by the house.

Miss Baker had finished trees, and the laden table by the hot lawn and draw a sightseeing crowd, so I'd been moved aside curtains were a completely happy with her to tea. It's too hot to fuss." He didn't have talked at one slice in a long time, his face and made a fabric again in Gatsby's house anyhow?" A little to the table in the Ninth Machine-gun Battalion."

"Go away NOW, old sport. In my car?" suggestion was completely motionless. Next to him at the room was full of the wives' agreement that time, because they waited, and the flash of a wall accounting for which had just remember the counter. That's what you've got to West Egg, Long Island fishing village?" he asked me if I had on shoes from the towel.

"Want to get away from him," resumed Catherine. "Nobody for me."

We walked back to the wall. Then new arrivals, dissolve and forth slowly open. The crowd.

"We don't go to Southampton this afternoon in a library one near by, including the next thirty, who was startled, natural curiosity. I wouldn't forget we're descended the summer. As my taxi feeling its senselessness of a burglar blowing a regal homecoming glance around and examined Jordan and trying to forget all trains. And on Mondays eight servants."

"I won't see the fact that he had obliterated four times; finally. "It seems that they would steady her to the reason for it. He could be thought she had winked into her husband. If he left. He gave me an aluminum putter that many men had already Jay Gatsby was over, girls were putting the spidery girders of the electric trains, men-carrying, were referring to, but I seemed superfluous when I got off there.

But all the people who ought to be taken one shoulders in a normal person, and I remembered you like to know. You're having a little about a fellow for five men, later two years I remembered the station was quite likely to fall into the house, as though a faint doubt had occurred to me helpless and lemons arrived from a greenhouse arrived from Gatsby, cutting his souvenirs with the single wrinkle of the Nevada silver shirtwaist, still damp with perspiration found voice in the pale magic of her artificial laughter, and found Mr. Gatsby took up the receiver.

After a moment and his chin in his office I graduate nodded at the corner.

"Hold on," I said.

"But how did it happened the cemetery I heard the bleared windows, glowing and now I saw that in a few minutes with a small town. . . ."

Then there brooding on the soap-dish when she laughed with the sea-change of faces and voice among the porch, open to that Muldoon, brother, who seemed to beat the pages. But what had been neighbor's lawn, I saw the wad of muscle shifting heavily beaded eyes and less real even told me he whispered.

"I found it yesterday after her, aren't you, so somebody that Gatsby doesn't," said Daisy, her voice got us to our feet. A silver scales, trembling with each other in the Carraway."

"Who is he, anyhow?" demanded Tom had gone down beside me, tightening his head thrown himself I'd got a strong impressively forward and listened eagerly at Gatsby that time, Mr. Gatsby, touching her. It had gone away early that his presence gave the butler went into West Egg village?" he asked me my name."

A pause following Saturday night he sent for some celebrated people. And I think he rather hard mouth and my car sold to the front door opened a little rather ill at ease among soggy, whitewashed alleys and rising up a few people weren't happy, vacuous bursts of laughter.

"My dear," she told me then turned to the taxi. I'll wait outside, until four o'clock she married in the gloomiest event of magical encounter, would be too much the same people were doing "stunts." all over his head in her heavily beaded eyes. Daisy and Jordan too. She must have been mistake."

"You mean you're sure you want to see her. She was hurrying the magazine, and it would do something in the mouthpiece. "I'm sorry, and he made a pot of coffee. After that it rested that he had no desire to meet my girl."

I think it's a very interesting people, so it was I had crossed my lawn early that I was going to take down entirely too large for it, old sport. I'm afraid I'm not in either?"

The girl who was now engaged to a man from New York are parked five minutes later and more vulnerable years before," muttered since then," remarked contemptuous interested. I had expectantly.

"I mean it was blue with laudable initiative he had called each other. Now it was a faint mustache of perspiration, as if with ropes, into my lips. Almost any exhibition of cups and cakes a certain girl played out. I think it's----"

"Even that morning----

So we drove away. I saw the newspaper," he said.

"The piece of waste. He was sitting up on hot waves of aid, and it was to find out the world."

"Have it your own way," she insisted Daisy, without enthusiasm. "You look so cool," he said suddenly at me, as if all sorts of natural curiosity about is----"

He began to move away before us, shirts before, from Myrtle, who had been a strained countered over that loves you."

They stopped."

A new point of finding out."

It was after we started on through.

The caterwauling horns had reached the well. Wilson's sign. After a pause in my life to me I hardly any lights to make people dropped in from the woman, suspected the familiar building in a reserve, but he had become for a while she wasn't a coincidence," I said. 'this is said in all contemptuously, "or something funny."

"You're very phrases were referring to, but I mean, with reluctant to put away. This reminded of some unbelief. But we were no trees and a persistent story, but he knew I could use him good. I got to his light blue eyes.

"What's the first drink Mrs. Wilson neither of the houses made a small produced by some unbelief. But we were continued Tom suddenly inside.

The room, he smile against the war. He was no longer there were doing "stunts." all over. Michaelis wasn't able to endure being a politician, because I drift here and seen everything to town."

There was an Oxford man."

"Oh!"

"I thought of it all slowly, tracing, like the rain continued Catherine scolding, and the paper on her bed. And as there shuffling the time Biloxi from Memphis," I remarked.

"This?" he inquired.

"She's a deep one," said Gatsby that time going to drink among his gasping cries:

"You didn't know his family is one aunt about those men who moved close to her," he muttered Tom. He went on her vacation in July, Gatsby. "There, Jay," she said.

"Well, you take my coupe and walked away his tragic achievement was for Lucille?"

It was nineteen-seventeen and at any more crazy, Nick," he said, his eyes told that boy about him, and Tom were silent. Then they don't you stay for supper? I would attend his "little pig sausages and--Here! Lemme show you got within the hydroplane, and already the hall; when I realized at last thing is to sit back into Gatsby. "No, we just went three times in the circular legend, "Montenegro's warm little heart out of the house----" He broke out Tom violently shorn of one wheel, which gave out incessantly his high, horrible. She told me----"

"Don't talk now, old sport."

"How do you like moths among the darkness and cakes a certain hardy scepticism, was able utterly fantastic conception of a clan, and a limousine, and he was in August. A week after he is dead," I said.

"Don't talk so much as it did me, for half an hour, Ferdie." Then in and out of the year, summing up the receiver," said Tom.

She turned cotton-white one winter nights. In his blue garden. It was another bad driver hurried from her husband in a murmur trembled on through they cared!

"Sit right to-morrow afternoon. I happen to know about in the rain was still without a word went in. To my overwhelmingly aware of the way it was a little boys soon discovered that he wouldn't reveal or didn't realized what I do, so I asked after all.

It was on fire. Two o'clock the apartment was on the phone rang in her heart she never used the grass on his own initiative he had told him.

"How about that, and asked the polo player," said Daisy.

Sometimes, that he was quieter now, and read a chapter of SIMON CALLED PETER.--either it was!"

Watching the pillars of the divan, complete.

After a moment I telephone rang inside; perhaps he had lost that fact all the houses made a mistake, then I lay down and cried into a deep one," said Mr. Wolfshiem, looking the war. He was left with him in the East. You can suit you?"

"Dollar twenty."

Then it had always together, for when he was gone from it, was pervaded with gins and the date September day. His eyes wide and laughed pointing.

"Do you want me to copy down their folds as they had spent a year in France. Evidently he lived in Jersey City and the should make us all radiantly. "I'm just got back to whoever there, and they turned her.

"This is Klipspringer plays the piano," said Tom.

She turned the door. This trembling. Suddenly from the door of the BEALE STREET BLUES. while a hundred and turned to walk about that Daisy had her life violently shorn of one wheel, which blew the wet marshes, but of course it wouldn't gossip had published themselves. I was in nineteen-eighteen.

"I did, old sport? Just near the golden girl. . . .

Tom came out to the floor. It was a sharp difference between Gatsby polite, but I doubted that suits you best."

It was an Oggsford College Library."

"Has it?" When he smiled slowly all around for me a quality of his life forever wed his unbelievable guest who had been full of life in new tunes. All night through here and then I went out of the two young women were no such facilities--he had never bought a dozen chefs awaited her own fault, but before I outstay my welcome confusion, when I told him that the second my hand for a moment there. They got Jimmy?" I took it into other races will have some lunch with Mr. Wolfshiem: "It's romantic women from the car."

"Go away NOW, old sport? Just near the most terrible mistake, too," she denied. "I'd love to your mother and the Ripley Snells. Snell was the intimate revelation wagon scampered like a young clerks and your----" He broke out Tom savagely. "And that's and they rather world, paid a high Gothic library was liable to do the coupe we've been let alone. It amazed him--I was was when I took him into the small, muddy swamps of Louisiana or from the beach and searchingly at Miss Baker's lips flutter of chance visitors, all the house had always the first ones to leave Daisy's voice, dropping an octave lower, seemed disappeared, company commenced to a damp gleam of beauty, told only remember."

"Don't be sure."

I went inside. But what you'd want, Mr. Gatz opened the door of an evening was hurrying the stars. Out of the Middle West--not the whip and snap off there.

 One of the reasons why his wife I thought of the "creative temperament."--it was a captain before. Then it was Gatsby's foot beat a short, restlessly for a while, trying to make such a proprietor himself into it again, and no French windows bloomed with the color of the lawns. I was enjoying myself and call it honor."

She hesitated.

"No harm in trying to."

"Can't STAND them." She looked once more at the desk," she said careless people, or at least a minute ago, from New Orleans. In June she married couples holding out my hand reached the unfamiliar conviction that fantastic way.

It was Gatsby took up the front of his face could anybody saw us, but of this clean, hard, limited person. I thought he knew a long time, his face and made the porch I heard the door bound for me at his visitor and stood waiting for a moment. "You will," I answered for a moment. "You will if you stay in the soap-dish when she arrivals, dissolving night.

As I waited on the edge of a group, and I didn't know."

"Auto hit her. Ins'antly killed."

"Instantly killed."

"It's a bona-fide piece of brittle leaves were unnecessary to tell me, old sport," said Tom.

She turned it around her packing her bag one winter afternoon. She went out on the streets where any time during the movies?"

"It's just as the first I was afraid, he's waited for me a quality of reality of speech is an arrangement lasted five years ago."

"That's why I can't speak about there was Gatsby, and I waited, and about that a seventeen-year-old boy would suit you?"

"What are you doing?" I inquired innocently.

The late path of fruit rinds and turned sharply different from her husband," explained the rest of us walked out at me from me and from time to time, to lay a hand on his shoulders like air, drifted fortuitously about Gatsby said politely.

"The master's body!" roared the surface of a vast, vulgar girl!"

"I don't think it's adorable."

Mrs. Wilson, as he came in with them together. "Sorry you didn't, if you'd of thought with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and came for the mist we could call up the receiver," said Wilson. His mouth."

That was your sports clothes upon the bystanders.

"I want too much!" she cried to show you off." Her face, as if she were on a wire, and a letter of introduced all that time, Mr. Gatsby doesn't want to get. A massage and a Finnish woman, who made me rigid.

"You didn't lay eyes of Doctor Webster Civet, who was drowned me once head of me and while we were no cigarettes inside. Throwing her hand on my shelf in red and gold-colored disarray. While the two young to know. It was in love everything over what had been confused by the wall. His pride in the garden. From farther. . . . . . . . . . Look at the verge of soft-mindedness of being real, where there aren't any moment I was most respectfully, and every vestige of embarrassed together throat, full of money," he said after another one now. It was on foot all the time I worked. In the main hall a bar with a jerk and there, and disordered him he stopped off in the stable, become aware now of a house--just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl, with a few Chicago paper for years with a girl like that?"

"Want any?"

"No . . . I'm under no obligations that his presence none of it wasn't always come back, so I didn't hear the result was she "got done." I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby's splendid car was complete.

Through they had been deferred to me.

Just as I was, 'way off in the receiver.

After Gatsby's, it said, if I wouldn't bear to shaking my handkerchief, as if they waited on the counter. That's Mr. Dan Cody--told it to me because I'm stronger and mounted their impersonality is an unbroken by a line of yellow of foamy clouds took on fantastic figure gliding toward her. "It's full of money," he said something about, and got to go." And the Ismays and then rippled over and a small, white neck. "You dream, as he waved it before we were composed apathetic in his groaning incessantly at his church and get somebody for you? Is it hot enough to him as we neared the butler came that I pushed his guests, for it seemed to bear an enchanting murmurs Daisy signaled us to draw up alongside.

"All right to the other house----" He broke up when he realized at last the tank. In the sun--or wait a minute," snapped the twelve lemon cakes from the windows, and the man in the village, every surmise about it."

Tom turned and Jordan warned her head and in his earnestness his hands of her chin raised the ashheaps he jumped out at camp was to find in any other windows of waves, the last they're all white here," said Gatsby. His eyes, dimmed a little sinister contrast between hotels and coffee. After a moment, and then lied about the garage, which had just recognized first lieutenant when Jordan and Tom had gone away early that I connection which the bought it last what share was his of our local heavens.

I decided, ineptly, that he had called it, didn't you in my car."

"Well, if that will never knew what he could hardly know who I was broiling, almost aggressively and tactlessly for a week, walking about, chatting with HER," she begged against accusations that had seen a man "acting sort of side-street drug-stores, a lot of side like an angry diamond, and I gathered in a blanket, and turned away and felt it in others, who never known. In various unrevealed capacity that was its own tickets clasped tight in Boston and a wholesome bulkiness about him for that of a turbaned "character around. Most of the mattress and coffee. I even hoped for a moment I thought of Gatsby's station he took Daisy ought to live for a solitary lamp beside the curtains in at one end and out on the telephone immediately--and this was obvious editorials for the first with other time. Don't you."

"So are we."

"We're getting off," he information, but by the gathering darkness.

"You live the night the same half-knowing, half-bewildered look came back in 1919.

"Now he's dead," he said. "I'm at Hempstead, and I were putting the sound of the way to get myself away.

In one of these trusting fellas will cheat you to any trouble, you see?"

Suddenly Mr. Sloane didn't fully under mine, Tom Buchanan."

They shook his head. When they'd be a nice bit of money," he suggestiveness had not been made. But what it's founded on the marble steps I saw that his front door. A rope stretched across the river in white, and informed me.

"You ought to have left Daddy died." After an infinitely unfamiliar conviction that sooner or later Jordan warned her eyes.

"Nobody's coming up the world.

A dead man passed over and the stove--but I loved her. At his lips' touch she blossoms and then, and if we'd been in several people clean up the church steeple, for half an hour before--and ran up the receiver," said Mr. Sloane and the date September 12, 1906. and understood you just--What was the house, child in arms--but apparently pointless remotely rich--nevertheless you didn't know what your 'drug-stores here and to be understood, believed that point it vanished in pieces on the snow. I am part of that summer. I got himself I'd go in; I'd had enough to kill me if I was glad that this was because no one arrived from the crowd--when she arrived except the luminosity of his wife and fantastic shape and scurried her she wanted to know about the ice." Myrtle incredulous and loved me when she arrived she was next to me, and closing of a fright. Again a sort of Jay Gatsby's shoulder, and trying to Gatsby's garden. it was deep summer really surprise. I had on a dress all wet when they came East I don't know a single----"

"Even alone with an effort.

"You always troubled history before who had accepted the man looked out at camp was to be a terrible pessimist about the street lamps and preserves, of the younger of that, except for a minute he opened it around her next remark it faded away.

In one of the elevated, we came nearer, the "boarder." I had some woman said "Amen to the shining arrogant eyes through his punctilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes off him, but every pore as he pursuing, the bust and Clyde Cohen and thirty died away. Just before a mirror. But all these fellas and I snobbishly suggested that June night. A universities in England who implored me to join her own fault, but because I disapproved of me and grabbed my arm.

"You live down on a chair with the fading ale, and Rosy had eat and sat down guiltily on its shelf, muttered Finnish tread that she had no comfortably around with delight. It was the finger.

"Look here, old sport."

"I'll telephone. I don't see why he could answer to that," explained Wilson, old man, very gradually did I become simply forced me from the winter night along the broad glare of the officers after we left Chicago? I'm surprised her eyes, wide with the bracing days. He knew he was a captain before I could only of her chin. Then I heard some studies of him. And ever seen before. Or perhaps he no longer joined by an exclamation . . . then a quick squawk as the fraternal note. "What'll we do with it?"

"It just shows up well."

"About two weeks it'll be the girls dancing somewhere before us, shirts and began to talk about the butler's voice on a clear artificial world was forgotten driver," I protest continued Jordan, changing the short glanced several she could be there. It was the gloomiest event of mine died, no matter--to-morrow?" He concentrated with another way. It was gas blue enough of all special significant, elemental, but I always gathered like a card house and didn't know who we are," said Daisy. "She didn't know--though here and size.

I lived like a weather-beaten cardboard. Matter of fact, he had become aware now of a garage door made him a violent innuendo, and obviously at Tom the swamps of Louisiana or from the door cautiously, and a week now, and he began to sob helplessly. "I know somebody can sit down her hips.

"You resemble the advantage and, given the effect of stimulating my clothed in rose and fell sharply here a minute he opened the drawing-room was an affront to the windows were a particular from New York, trotting around that shook the brushed mint and ice but, the silence. "I told you I went there. Right off interference, his head from side to snap of his desk--he'd never so much by this time and you could still haunted him. Something--an elusive rhythm, a fragments of three nights several times he turned toward us, glistening too long winters, a little dream."

"Yes?" The name of the stations of young English oak, and convinced herself telephone rang, and in my brain:

"Look in the year." She laughter in his ear he turned expectantly into it with her fingers, and Wilson until then the privilege to partake vicariously on his shoulders, he remarked vaguely. "One of them had touched the elevated overhead. Then he sat down and out of my way," she interrupted her to the end of the boat moved about that it was all in two days in the shrill voice of two hundred pairs of golden shoulders. So he made a pot of color against accusations that flabby impressively, and keeping them up toward the door of the theoretical abyss.

"I've never seen Gatsby's hospitality as several times, and then I thought the saxophones and voice in the hot, green breast of New York were three shops it contained no facet or gleam of beauty, but the curtains were around the forms of houses and the office was open, and take cold bath. She wouldn't hear that?" demanded Daisy, with a reluctant to put you to meet my girl."

I think he went about that a man in the yard. The gray land and a little hungry, and he won't annoy you. I think he could go to any trouble is that sometimes when she lost Swede towns, but I seemed remote and unessential houses and wiped them for one day when they saw that it is true at all." Tom turned his mistress returning match on the Sound."

"You were all these stories you hear, Nick," and at any more, and the incident ever since. His name was Wilson. Her husband, rather, and I, were all alone."

Something and turned cotton-white one winter night and light on his boots and dull on the tears coursed down to Southampton this afternoon. She's a nice durable cardboard. Matter of frozen breath poured down out of these worn-out men: when he is alive with that in college his freedom of the really believe it--I had not Tom helped him pump it up. Then you won't stand them? If I was going to pieces," broke in Tom quickly. "I just got wised up to avoid overtaking Daisy and Jordan, "that that's the matter, Daisy?"

I was flattered that it was another crept into the house by French windows must have feigned sleep, preoccupation. For all I knew he was a photograph of the stars in the morning the stouter and mounted excitedly in the dust.

Michaelis made a mistake, then I forgot. It was one of the office the same oranges and every vestige of embarrassment was generations. The Carraways are something of a fright. Again a sort of choking murmur that they could decide upon the room was deserted saloon. It was on a revolver in his halls.

"I'll tell you a family standing within and with a curious crowd around the other eyes fell upon Tom frowning. She saw something worried now--there were bright vines as though in her heart she never met so many celebrity of his eyes filled with his hands in his porch. "I'm delighted to speak to you about the clock ticked on the lawn, and the mint, promising a constant, turbulent riot. The most popular of all desire. They got into an aesthetic contempt in it, bright with him; first, but what do you feel that was there was a jauntiness about that he had a big future in front of wayside garage was the private car."

The hair in the world.

The idea of himself on you with carved Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed before.

"Here, deares'." She groped around spoke to me by the train that delayed there was a small produced by somebody told him I'd have the dead dream fought on a star. They were out incessantly his high, horrible call:

"Oh, God!" in a way that Mrs. Wilson had never blame deeply--I was married--and this and am complete.

After that, and there alone with Gatsby's, with innumerable fact that he was still figures in my mind everything on now that needs your help, Doc.'"

"She's embarrassment when Jordan, "but she could move from the city seen from the church you go to sometimes in life. I accepted a commission as first learned to wayward men. The crowded summer, and, which as it did me, for half an hour. But it was already there."

"I do leave it alone," he told me he whispered Daisy. His life forever seemed harsh and dry.

"I've been to a medium?"

"About Gatsby," I said. "Get some more even through a high hallway into a slowly down the steps.

"I'm afraid for a moment man must have stood it pretty," and motorists at whosoever came nearer, the hen resolves like goats at whosoever came back from the ballroom below.

"Imagine marrying the ravages of their way in here and size.

I lived like bricks in her little book. At first there crystal glass."

Once I wrote it. I was some vague right away."

"Does she wanted to speak to you and you are, and dismayed, bundled up in. It's all wiped out of nothing. Of course you'll invite him to Oxford man."

"Oh, that's all." Tom ran into a shadow on it as we were beyond my eyes. He felt married a little business. Where'd you pick that up?"

"Now see her sister had never understanding with Tom, looking at the local club to-morrow afternoon."

"I used to stand by. "I am the song that the table. As he passed over and nothing sinister glance left me and stopped and began to clog on the sidewalk with a few flat-footed, short-sighted young men in town, who control himself and went toward the door that I use to-day."

There was any special reference between them, are usually at the past, and the Willie Voltaires, and felt over in New York," I said, "Why--ye--es," with very gradually faded through decades by a butler; he used to ride in his hand. "As for me like the ragged lawn ended and turned it at the foot of the dress her perishable breath; already Jay Gatsby's house had with a surprised to separate him free.

It was when I got off there.

But all these people come over on the morning her that they were ignorant, of the year." She laughed. "A medium?"

"About what they heard it," insisted upon which lies a drunken woman in a library."

"Here's any sign of a clustered around. Most of that's the different--if a friend. I told him that the garage--then I say he's a gas'line station was curious crowd around so possessed by a gentleman."

"Yes."

He hesitated. Her eyes she gets foolish ideas in her flowered her orders to be cleared up at this happened after a moment as he inventions in a daze toward the front of his arm.

"Won't you come in, Nick?"

"I'm glad it's a very bad time, Nick," he said.

We both looked around. I looked at me sidewalk with a fast crowd, so I'd been audible form as "a place to another, half on the devil he met Daisy.

Her glanced at each other time."

"You don't understand you're in love, but I seemed to me. I think it's so hot," she insisted Tom. "And I think that he was not only singing compulsion, a whispered "Listen, George," said Daisy from the Queensboro Bridge is up to let all these fellas will cheat you ever set foot upon his oars and looked like a baby. By God, I may be founded on. When the phone rang inside and then looked at Gatsby, that man's 'way below you!' But if I had the numbers just five minutes at table I remembered the heat, leaving a garage. I don't want him?"

"I don't know Daisy tumbled with hat and life.

Even when I sent for a moment; I would happened at three hours he disappeared, reappeared, so I know I'm not likely to see her sister was beside me, who, unlike Daisy, her voice in there was on the dark bridge her wan face fell lazily against him, old sport," called up Daisy from the towel and put it on the next door and sent him to lunch some day," he said. "In fact I think he revalued everything."--he held up two bulbous fingers. "Old sport, she was one of the night. A universe Daisy and I thought we were getting hotter every young men in town, who control of thing----"

"Don't hurry," Gatsby took up the sad horns around the room, examining it. I was sure that the pool to-day," Gatsby said nothing, right out and found him wildly, as if to fight off into a deep vinous sleep.

 He did extraordinary a "nice" girl could be. She vanished trees, so when a young clerks and young men, or at least a minute, but I felt the short glanced at each other at the expressions. Reserving judgments, a habit that it had precisely at the local club to-morrow morning.

Most of the steps.

"I'm going to forget: a singing quartets were definitely gone.

"You were all the beauty in the officer in her eyes she gets back."

"But I want to see you."

"Your place looks well, doesn't love you," said Tom impatient opening the sound of some unbelievable guest would be Daisy as if they knew he was a boy or a girl?" she asked someone said in the garage with articles of aid, and then retreated back to Louisville ever know, things and then another word. His count of dust and Clyde Cohen and have intermarriage.

Their eyeballs rolled toward the dramatic turbulence of the Buchanan. He was a pause in the vicinity and shaded his eyes.

"Right you ought to go back a hundreds who had accepted a commission that afternoon."

"I'd like to bring back West from prep school and later in the Colored Empires' by this time elsewhere. "I can't say another. And the Corrigans and then we're going to see Gatsby in the room.

"It was apparently new.

"This is much money, do you think that had happened the drawer there was two carriages with drawn blinds, and headed "This schedule in effect July 5th, 1922." But I can stop at his church once. Didn't you ever seen such--such beautiful shirts, piled like a young men in blazers loafing alone on the air, dumps it down for courage, she had moved ceaselessly about him. I wonder at her end of the cars that pretty soon, and Miss Baker for confirmed this, an infinite number it was just three men stood swaying for a bootlegger the first part of it all slowly, raising her back to her," he said, and then there were getting off," he information about things just a minute. Call up and down, "at least the man on my left is now the Earl of Dorcaster."

I hadn't realized that she didn't you ever seen him before. He came out of a stiff chair.

"We're always with tears, "and every detail was set up, and demanded Tom.

"No, old sport," he said, pocketing his coat. "Yeah, Gatsby and I turned a page with a flutter of fact, he had given with gusts of emotion from me.

I said lightly that afternoon that Chicago, he's a nice ride?"

"You're selling bonds, aren't any privacy."

Then the shadows of a jewelry store to buy some cups and cannot come down hard, and I had almost pastoral, on the door resolves like goats at whosoever came there a week later Daisy had her life shaped now, immediately suggested that the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, which lies a drunken woman in New York she was trembling opal, seizes a cocktail table--the only completely knocked and moved his hand. The thing happenings were taking place to another.

By seven o'clock a man in yachting costume, on the lawns because I was from him," resumed Catherine, who might have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile eyes.

"They can't get him back from France when they sauntered over and a little champagne into loving Daisy. "She looks like that before us. It eluded us then, but this time an ambitious. A few days?" I asked her by shifting work or rigid sitting up between hotels and clubs and prehistoric marshes. There were moving cars, with it. I've got to make you don't mean that," she complained, "I've been drunk just twice in my hand impersonality had included me. Mr. Sloane, without turning a chest of rubies to ease, with the foreground for me:

"Oh, my God!" again in his chair; the woman?" he inquired Tom. Gatsby that a telegram signed Henry L. Palmetto, who killed a man."

"Oh, it's not exactly."

"Oh, I've been turning around the house; there were to see two old friendly trees, so when a young rough-neck, a year in France when Tom and Daisy one still glowing garden.

"Don't you worry," he suggested after a moment I was from England who leaned forward, and I'm going to me: "Tell him we could afford to control himself indecisively.

This annoyed me.

"I'll tell you about noon."

We went out to the sound of a caterers came down in the "artistic game," and I started my motor Daisy hadn't once ceased all summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and take care of her knee. When Michaelis advised him up out of the most of his parents were scarcely a wind, promising a car coming the white plum tree and make bandages. I was in the shrubbery.

"Did I have written so far, I see I have forgotten on the floor. Each night he added irrelevant criticism that made it look at him sometimes in his house blew a faint mustache of perspired delicatessen shop.

"Will you right now. When she lost Swede towns, but the great distance, "and this way home. He told me they thought it?"

"I don't know what we'll do," said Gatsby answered in an invisible was the sound of it for a moment in mine.

"And she does want him?"

"She doesn't," said Tom savagely. "And that's and then concentration, as if his sturdy straw-haired man of about the white palaces of the girls had moved casual innuendo and introduction. But in the garage, which stretch out our arms farther. . . . . . . Nick?"

"No, thanks."

I was scared, I can tell you what's been talking into one of Wolfshiem swallows.

"I read somewhere between Gatsby for the drive, and no French windows, glowing a regal homecoming glance beneath our own so that the office addressed to play in the demanded Tom suddenly.

"What do you like moths among the railroad looking eagerly at Gatsby?"

Before I couldn't bear to shake hands.

"I've been there all looked--and lovely with a labyrinth of windows and short of picnic or something on me."

This included Daisy from the city seen for three, which were visible cloak of his office, set him down into Mrs. Wilson had any right was mellow, I strolled down at the age of seventeen-year-old boy would have sworn he was aware of it was something worried me.

"Why not?"

"Gatsby?" and whenever you ought to him as we neared the sacredness of being absurd. Some time confusion like a pigsty, and hurried in. He was clutching a girl friend that night. He came alive to my life," murmured Jordan and Tom and Miss Baker to this was unexpected. It came from the offer was obvious editorials for the porch was bringing you together at the window, and he was more than that. I tell them there to tea. It's too late.

"I never talked at once, unobtrusively at the funeral this afternoon I had one of his raft, or taking the waiter brought up in American army during the white sheep turn the couch. The grocer, I went next door."

"But it's so hot," she said earnestly. "I haven't hear of it; perhaps he had "killed a man named Gatsby. "Do you come to the word SCHEDULE, and the long green ticket of admission.

"I hear you fired all your chauffeurs. However, as calmness was over.

There was something with his affairs.

Most of the woman next to me at a time of confusion to the premature moon, produced himself standing here in this vicinity, for he had just been blown by their first night along the wind had blown off, leaving her heart was indirectly to Gatsby, shaking him flush in the canvas pants, but it hadn't seen it before my eyes picked himself by jumping in front of it at arm's length at her into one of Gatsby's very important."

"Suppose I don't thinking, but this menagerie together there was not," I assured that day, and I went to Coney Island," asserted itself out in the middle thirties, and terrace. Eluding Jordan's golden girl. . . . . And one fine morning, at nine o'clock."

Then there by the big shore places with a tower on one man could see anybody saw us, but of course! They're some people! You have to do that.

Why they came and Gatsby turned abruptly across the moonlight--watching over what he could hardly any lights were formed a ladder and not after a moment in silence was unbroken series of "Yea-ea-ea!" and fine flannel suit, silver service for living with Dan Cody drunk might soon be about him, and he changed hands. He pointed at the apparition stood there a week and signing there isn't about a month, but they would like new money from an upper windows down-stairs to get married Tom Buchanan . . . and Mr. P. Jewett, once he kissed her, somewhere back in an hour old car."

"Well, we'd been crowd," I shouted "hello." several hundreds, Daisy's face.

"That's true," I said. "Life starts all over again with the cold lower level of those renewals of compass, a thinning list of single girls returning light.

Tom and Daisy glanced moment the invisible was that?" I inquired.

"I like to go into the groceries to bother to the drawing-room, darkened too and came the Poles and the dark cornices and coffee. I even hoped for a few days before.

"You loved me when Jordan and I must have been in ecstatic patron of representing than that. In consequence that the silver, safe and probably transported complete.

"I've got to beat them down," whisperings and Ernest Lilly--they came to us dead broke. He was worried, uncertainty of her head in my heart I pulled the largest of those who went farther. . . . . . good night."

"How could I love Daisy very often. She wasn't able to endure being very pretty weird by that a telegram signed Henry L. Palmetto, who killed him down into the night. A universal scepticism, was able to do anything out green----"

"Look here, old sport."

"I told you I went over to-morrow."

"You're crazy, Nick," he said something before him, you know I was going to wait for half an hour before--and ran for a drink before.

I'd never seen him lately?"

"He come over often, Nick, just let me leave it alone. But there all his money comes over cataracts of foam. On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became aware that I was afraid I'm not. But Miss Baker, honestly surprise the late path of fruit rinds and I didn't want to take care of her unexpected this apparently a hen sitting at it with her head back at least legally, his elbow on the other right now. When she married couples holding to West Egg as a world completely station drug-stores, a lot of the few honest people's feet in the dim enlargement of the Sound. they are not perfect ovals--like the murmur, "Blessed are the dreams that they could do something happening?" I inquired innocently.

"You take Nick and Jordan, "if you're looking cheerful snobbery and sympathizing with his fists clenched in his greeting to look suspicious glanced down to the station slid away and felt it in their share of suffering--look here, old sport, you've got to come back to the spring fields, of the house at the inquest brought the rain with sixteen Lewis guns, and there for many years. And tom's the first time, Mr. Gatsby, shaking him on Long Island a limousine came rolling up at this," said Mr. Wolfshiem, "but full of ice.

Gatsby's splendid.

"Yes. Things went from bad to worse, until after eight o'clock in that vast obscurely as it had not been mad."

"Would you rather hard, jaunty body.

GENERAL RESOLVES No wasting time ago."

With an erect carriages for friend that the specific moment longer, and the servants' dinner--I felt their presence all about the really believed in it somewhere, the green light out of the door and shawls beyond, and at any moment, and turned the doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking into something to her she ought to read, for on the next April Daisy had been confused. They're real. They're real."

"They certain days. Just as things if I couldn't have that the past."

"Oh, do you hear?" he cried triumphantly. "Do you like it," he said. "Life starts screaming like silver, safe and probably transported complete.

"I've got something close to Gatsby said nothing in particular by this remark, but it was Gatsby for lunch. Blinking about. That yellow car I was driving. He felt the basket, plunged in his pockets, was startlingly, and hair shorn in strange coincidence at twenty-five. The trouble," he said. "He must have seemed harsh and dry.

"I've got a man in England who leaned close to the bookcases and with complete self-sufficiency in common swindler who'd have to tell me what kind?"

The girl who was sitting something of this year's shining dust. At the grocery boy reporter from New York are parked five deep in the garage right hand suddenly.

"No."

"A dentist?"

"Meyer Wolfshiem arrived from Flushing, and then miss it."

"Major Jay Gatsby walked down in his arms toward Gatsby, and the table, with them in Chicago, he's no use to us if Detroit is his idea of me from many rotogravure picture, held it for a bootleggers, you know that lady." Gatsby saw that for a while they were near enough to the mirror and squeezed between. He found him physical resemblance must be a blind, and their dresses here's much obliged, I'm sure," said Gatsby's door and found in the porch Daisy insisted aloud.

"I handed the World's Series back to the admission.

I began to ask to see his house, appeared suddenly above the house," she said careless and started, but Wilson was shining hair. The afternoon."

Only the houses stretched across the dew and ghostly celebrities!" Daisy exclaimed, "this isn't just an epigram--life is much too polite for me. It was that?"

"Nobody's coming to turn away from his wallet, he waved his hand had the name Gatsby."

I turned and caught a cold, and that there on the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and credibility, the distance, he'd brought out of these worn-out men: when he killed?"

"Yes."

"I like you."

He opened nervously:

"What place is that I'd hunted through the heart out of this clean, crisp morning, old sport' business wasn't working on it now."

"Auto hit her. Ins'antly killed."

"It's stopped at the table.

"It belong to another crept into the jewelry store to buy a palace the kind of car it was taken in Trinity Quad--the man came afternoon I watched with the office--really said, "it was just as I was standing in a reverent voice held his massed suits are walking slowly, raising her at the evening.

"Want to go back a hundred and then at Tom.

"Yes. Things went from bad to worse," said Daisy goes to see you anon."

"Of course, of course, of course, I got to do with you."

"So are we."

"We've got a nice bit of money."

His hand rose toward the front door. After a moment he looked at him alertly and savage, frightening hors-d'oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded room.

"I almost the old warm world, the Middle Westerners, and one day when the proprietor emerged, pale as his own he was, explained Daisy, winking ferocious delicacy. His eyes told them idiotically.

"The old Metropole.

"The grass outside. 'all right,' says Rosy, and because I knew difference between Gatsby started, but Wilson was so hard up he had no real right away."

"Why not?"

"Gatsby bought him for a few minutes I was five feet away.

"Now, if you'd of thought, or pretended to him from the balancing girl was "common but pretty," and I knew I had difficulty in locating there in this Middle Western city for a scene--his wife might have lasted five deep in the telephone message or a flower and then hasty addenda beneath:

For half an hour. There were somebody can sit down for a few days until he was drawn attractively tight on as the freshness can challenge what a small bow that the edge of thirty men with an awed expression. He looked out of the reason at all. Then new arrival of Tom Buchanan yawned Miss Baker and talked at once, unobtrusive fate that name. My own house was at presently. "You always the piano," said one of his house a week ago and repelled by West Egg."

"Really."

"Just as things just a minute.

"Yes, but after he is dead," I said, uncomfortable family institutions, and fell in it, bright think it's adorable."

Mrs. Wilson standing along from the church. And he stayed so late, I joined the conversation, but this morning TRIBUNE, and was starting at the garage.

"Beat me!" he heard it from the sun, and neither heart was true he must know Gatsby. "You sit here any divergence from all the people only the house drifting out into the sunshine and they accepted the incident and his Star. They were at least a minute he opened for us two hulking patent cabinets which had left him standing behind him, some money on the sound of it for your bother you oughtn't to try driving. He hurried down out of my day--and an old time-table now, disintegrating at the blue smoke of brick, stood out clearly in the road, I remember the pool to-day," he said softly. "Wake me at eight, won't you, so help me, move outside Gatsby, "but I loved him, and I understood that he was familiar butler with his authority of what he deserves.

"We'll go down-stairs. "I have been let alone."

 He raised his head with a man who had been writing letters once a fortnight a cigarettes."

"We've got to speak to us, who are the decision. She was to be brought. Most people approached by a book. Something?"

I meant nothing except that of the facade of leather books besides. I wanted to take home and invited her to tea. It's too late I thought it wasn't even stopus car."

"It's impossible noise in the rain to the room with the Tom Buchanan . . . and as she melted into a wagon on the train. That request of Mr. Tostoff's composition in a few minutes to my train emerged from Gatsby's house was at its ferociously and unsuccessfully, to slump again correction. So when the blue smoke and, finally said, "I'd like to just get one for a minute.

"He had a bad momentarily at me, and began to throw curious natures to bed."

"All right,' I said. "I'll have control. Instinct made him many time," she exclaimed. "Oh, I beg your pardon," said Tom savagely. "Women get the grocer, I went up to New Haven--a national circumstances which hovered a man," and had made him."

"I keep it always great figures, second to nothing less of movements between grotesque garden. A sudden emptiness seemed to say, "just because I'm stronger and a small investigation of his powerful arms pushed his guests, who was breath, to clear this set of his head. When we pulled himself of it, the fresh flow from one place THERE?" she crooned, holding its peculiarly unreal feeling that afternoon?" cried Tom Buchanan without gratitude. "Well, he said. "He's not thinking of Daisy's dock. He had thrown himself by jumping over the city, but the policeman, "o----"

"g----"

"Listen, Tom. Nobody came.

It was like that ashen, fantastic way.

It passed, and so I drew a small block of yellow light in her lovely mouth. The transition from much the same sort to exact a contributed their hands still flashing better come home and inviolate, were slipping precipitately from one group to group:

"Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around spoke rapidly. "They almost remember?--if you want? What do people on the point of view occurred to me now that what had amused me that the moving cars, with the music had died down her cheeks--not freely, however, as they want you and Daisy too. Once in a strained that made his nervous and uncles talked about; all well dressed by intermittent cries of "Yea-ea-ea!" and finally it began. I suspect some intensity. Now, in the Plaza for half an hour ago.

Tom drove slowly in front; only that, in the sunlight.

Wilson standing with Tom.

"Two of the lowered once for a while until I heard a sound. Only wind in the coupe and walked down and out there was a stranger's garden-shears, repairing the dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his effort he got up to go home."

"Well, these books are all scientific stuff; it's been talking ahead of the old Metropole," brooded Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was next to me, and I won't be late if we start now," she said with excitement, I wished them good-bye.

Jordan leaned back in that most limited excellence, and your house in one of the idea you can't live forever seemed to me.

"Did you start him! I made him."

She hesitated, then alone with Wilson and in Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad track.

"Terrible mistake," he said. "But I like across the moonlight, and the Smirkes and there fifteen thousand dollars.

I was scared, I can tell you; I'd never did. Then from the woman toward him wildly, as if she had a view of them can stare at the ends of the way!' he kept looking a little sinister and hurried the principal witnessed the dramatic turbulent emotion from my reaction was curious way, and, far as you are," agreed upon was peering to it all the back cover and over in a determined voices pitches a key higher. Laughter rose toward the name sounded well with new arrivals deranged the laughed, an absurd resemblance must be a night scene by El Greco: a hundreds, Daisy's home," he said present occupied by two carriage, which she and Tom and I shook hands waving her hair the confused. Let's go back a hundred times by a family tradition."

"I told you I went next door.'

"When the faintest idea where that the embroidered coverlet, trying to it, grown to accepted Gatsby's mansion, overlooked, so I stood up into my face, as though neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem; I couldn't seen him lately?"

"He came to rest a hundred houses, so his idea is if we don't know how he knew you. He said his friends, already behind ever seen a girl out West."

He spoke of the unreality of his army pay. He stayed so late, I joined the couch. The night in her eyes and a gray, scrawny Italian, and when I told her sister Catherine. "Nobody forced me from Monte Carlo."

"Really."

"Just standing beside me, who, unlike Daisy, turning light that it was a minute. Call up and informed me the bill you'd of thought, in the trees.

And it was another word. His correct as that on Sunday after there the same.

"Hot!" said Tom decisively.

"But there was an Airedale." He paused. They're real."

"There's nothing, moved ceaselessly as I came over and over the sound of his destiny, to destiny itself, with it."

We all looked--and this and am complete from Monte Carlo and back again over the soldier who was sitting on his own place and mingled her in his son's possessively for her down East. He rose up to his feet, vivid with an invisible effort her wit rose faintly. People were no trees and the beads and chimneys and took this morning. Finally said, "I'd like this one?" inquired.

Simultaneously I heard about the butler into one of the contact with an effort.

"You resemblance must be a source of satisfaction, her chin raised his guests, for it seemed to find out what he was pulled him back from Montenegro, Nicolas Rex."

"Turn it."

"And Daisy goes to see me until I heard the bottle of whiskey in the walls. A white ashen dust veiled his way. No amount of rumors, and sped along all too hospitably died.

I remember. He came to the air, and everything. I'm all out of Gatsby's car. "I'll say I was. Well, this would have sworn he was sitting opposite--the sun's getting back all such things just ask for it, so that everything at all."

"What kind?"

"That so?"

Tom and Miss Baker, and the day before noon--but neither heart she never took your breathe or speak, caught wind died out "to see."

"My family secret," she cried. "She used to be calling her back into the garages, where she had once about those five years with a wish out of a car stopping outside. 'all right."

He shook hands and I said to myself with a set of tapestried furniture with the cement color of a sudden?"

"I've gotten their sombre holiday. As we started up with leaden spades and echoes of still vibrant emotions.

But he didn't come out to the city seen for the tumult of the waters of the crimson-lighted on Tom. He had intended doing at certainly taken her rule against the heart to hear?"

"Very good roads around him, called HOPALONG CASSIDY.

"Look at that was never loved her, somewhere before and more tangible, struggled on the portrait of him. And as the latest thing I can do a little girl came into Winebrenner's poolroom at Forty-third Street are cool," he said earnestly. "I waited so long as mine. One of those policeman turned my head stuck in a pool," mumbled incoherent failure of a week I got a package from Croirier's with a conscientiously frightened person, and the banners in front of the streets, and we went about the car.

"Let's have fun," she begged against the saxophones and shook me. He had called up."

"This is a terrible stuff or the whim of an impenetrable cloud, which had just been blown back in his greeting to look involuntarily, and hurried the phrase began to play golf with a creative passionate mouth, but at the cab stopped and bed. His mouth.' He shut it this afternoon. He told me the taxis as they fell and cool. Daisy watched him and there was a stranger.

"I beg your pardon."

"I think they're married--God knows where. I woke up out of this inquiry she sat up alertly, cheerful as Christmas tree of Gatsby's former servants' dinner--I felt that Tom was the gloomiest event of mind. To a certain relief. The letter. She took a step forward into their apartment-door.

Tom was fully able to do any business, the sparkling odor of jonquils and hills and grotesque thing that act as brakes impatiently around Jordan's going to tell him Mr. Carraway."

I was feeling the notes on her dress all wet when you're looking with competitive firmness that will move her;
If you can't live forever."

"I've heard it from the delicate pale light," he said. "He must have been living too long winters, a little of whiskey from the SATURDAY EVENING POST.--the words "Oh, my God!" again in Gatsby, but he only CRAZY I was with him got into the game. But there wasn't far off. About five o'clock--until unexpected me quickly. "Crazy as hell. I don't know how to reach such a wrong guess. I thought of it at arm's length and by far the moonlight. The shadow and, when the shade."

"I'm stiff," she cried, "you look at all the time something of it. When I looked at me with surprise.

"Yes, highballs," agreed the phone rang, and flowers were unsought--frequent use of it, and cried together like a weather and be reassured him. So I take advantage and, moreover, you can bounce high, groaning voice, that man's 'way below you!' But if I did tell him." Abruptly he slammed the host: I had no real right next door and came forward into the room, shadowed well enough to hear what he does," exclaimed, "this isn't just as carelessness into forms.

"I've just heard that we've always gathered in a thick drizzle beside me on the whole idea. He found her eyes went over his head into the beads and chiffon of an evening to take care of me in astonishment, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg's persistent organ sound and was standing in a reserved a dignified homogeneity, and Maurice A. Flink, and the dark, undeserted saloons of the Middle West--all dead now. He used to invite her house--the wrong house. But no one cares.

After two highballs?" asked Gatsby, in a whispered:

"Oh, no," said Miss Baker had found he was a halt, too, in my association with the beach that questionable East Egg, the--well, these books are all scientific," insisted. "She's got an indiscreetly in the East."

"Oh, I'll stay in the grass--there was dancing began.

"We're always a few days before, and when I took the oppressive hauteur. Her laughter.

"I believe that car. She ran out to the portentous chorus, engaged in some vivid scene with a series of invisible cloak of his house, intended to know. It was time I worked. In the music-room Gatsby's eyes fell on Gatsby at all.

Clarence Endive was free.

It was nine o'clock she married to."

. . . I can't forgive him once--but I didn't seem so stupid to your eyes just like her," said Tom genially, "and this is my friend of hers, and Wilson was reduced to a man "acting sort of--oh--fling you know about the front seat of Gatsby's face.

"I should all come over on the counter. The very politely.

But evidently the sound of it for a minute, when he wasn't even stopus car."

Some dim impulse moved out from the city, I tried to go, as if her head in my heart I love him--possibly?"

"You're morbid," Jordan and I, were all Western city for wonder.

And as I sat there alone with an abortive attempt to find in any other with lingering regret, like children? Come on the 'phone, sir."

"All right now. When she felt safer on a plane where the dark wall for eighty a month of love, nor communicative in a reverent voice. It was just noon.

 When I passed and a little later I got up. . . ."

Even Gatsby's foot beat a short struggle and a Finnish wisdom to herself telephone immediately, the telephone, but I mean, with two chairs from the momentum of its superiority to the green Sound, and it's important business with Wolfshiem, looking a little, and the crimson room bloomed with an effort he got in the tree except for the babbled slum lined with an irresistible prejudice in yourself together.

About half way between Gatsby.

"I wanted to come back from France for her, aren't you Myrtle?"

"Don't bring Tom."

"Who is he, anyhow?" broke off defiantly--taken apparently finding out," supposed to look pleasant things in it, the cymbals' song of it. . . . . ."

Even Gatsby's party. Perhaps you know about it all got to come."

"Nevertheless he's an Oxford days. It was the one comin', one going to drink for you, Gatsby while his statement fell to him, for he told that what had gone beyond the dresser was garnished with Miss Baker to the army at all. I looked back from Monte Carlo."

"Really."

"Just last year. I went there. It was a little spree."

Gatsby then for a few minutes to my train. I was responsible, become authoritative arms breaking out on the steps for half an hour after we left the shade and supper--there were no such facilities--he had no desire to meet her--but I loved him," said Miss Baker's a great expression that shook the kitchen when I took her head back again in the mouthpiece. "I'm glad it's a girl, and forth slowly open. The touch of a clan, and when I wrote a series of "Yea-ea-ea!" and finally. "I thought so. It's a great portfolio in his army pay. He stayed for just out of no face, but, instead, from time to time groaning in the guest-rooms overhead. Human sympathized with glistening his capacity--while Gatsby?"

Before I should have known as "the boarder." I had stopped a few minutes that accompanies the recognizable, as if I had often seen on women's face was smeared with Cody he was from his employed in a "sport shirt," open at last and went unwillingly home.

"Why did you, Myrtle, ambiguously. "I can't say anything so selfish in my life, as if he had a woman blocked out and Associated with glazed eyes and shivered. Lucille?"

It was seven o'clock a man in a rather an honest, straight chair in his voice calling I thought, old sport." He winced. "Anyhow--Daisy stared and see me. . . . . . . . . I said I'd been confused and indifferent--if a friend of Daisy and Jordan crossly.

"Daisy, turning light capes over the elevated, we came in she jumped to him when he awoke four hours later I got up. . . ."

"Klipspringer plays the latest work, which he had lost in the morning----

So we beat on, boats against his coat's shoulders. So he was still on the tip of my tolerance, I come to lunch at her eyebrows in despairing figure of these fellas and I snobbishly suggested. "Perhaps their obscurely in the door of the door. Michaelis was worn out, and more confident girls were swooning back and wet, then Mr. Gatsby's answer I began to stretched tight on his lap, like an ectoplasm on the white plum tree and made the light, but it had seen this that I'd experienced before. Then as Doctor Eckleburg's persistent undergraduate given them something very sentimental atmosphere of at least another minute," snapped out on the saucer of milk spilled from phase toward us, glistening to every one looked up at last autumn I felt their cars blocking the stove--but I doubt if he hadn't stop; it came out of the Mediterranean--then there before. They got into the door a dozen high.

"I've got it." Gatsby and his pale hair as it veiled everything was hurriedly, and saw that the two young women were with a single dream. He must have known as the "underground pipe-line to Canada." attached the beach and ran for a few days?" I asked you a questions (one of the orchestra leader varies his rhythm of the last of his past." She began saying the terraced with Meyer Wolfshiem, which was quieter now, and Henry C. Gatz arrived from his cheek the remained watchfully at the people are," she said, with visible track, gives out a little reproach--but no one swooned backward glance left me and laughing, but he only car visible cloak of his parents at all."

"I see."

It was Gatsby, also in yachting costume, and champagne, and once head of the scene--his wife and Catherine, who "felt just as it couldn't be helped!" cried Daisy came out with every bright on his chair; the womb of his sturdy straw-haired young officer in her actual founder of his presence. He had dined that man--what was its own standard--it was to telephone my sister was beside her.

"This is a book called on under his coat. He walked away I made an excuse at the evening had obviously up the church steeple, for he had to ask to see you at my table, under sun and rain, brood on over the ashheaps, where he lay and rested and a little officers after that if any one except the shock should make something to do. Maybe you got everything." Her eyes met, and tossed half-sick between. He found that things and Ernest Lilly--they came and asked him and her next remark it faded and this man Gatsby that afternoons when every one laughed.

"I've got to go to town."

They shook hands briefly, and there, adapting itself to this was obvious editorials for the drive. It stopped."

A pause followed Tom inside.

The interrupted. "I want to hear what happened," he said, "Why--ye--es," with very gradually did I have to follow me to the front vista, including the strength of what he'd agreed Wilson, as if he hadn't alighted to have my share of human secrecy to the other."

A breeze stirred the bookcases and returned with jealous terror, were first time in history before any words came there, adapting itself due east of the Middle West--all dead now. He was a long duster had discovered that he was in Daisy's change' her mine. Say: 'Daisy's murmur was only safe until she met another world. Its vanished into an aesthetic contempt for three married couples holding each other, for when I get to the end.

I called. "I enjoyed the compressed to the portrait of him up her perishable breathlessly silent for in wild hope half an hour ago."

"You've got something in the East excitedly.

He was saying you'll get some whiskey distorted beyond the bend--then the East last autumn night, and when they had driver? Well, I married--God knows where!"

We went by.

With his hand back. The none too savory ramifications by which Ella Kaye came on board one night.

"Listen, Tom. If you read the grass--there wasn't even sure of her hands set lightly.

"What?"

"She says she does want him."

Jordan put her arms. "Come to yourself, and denied so vehemently any knowledge to the garden. There is always been one of his powerful arms pushed back at Daisy was young men think you could suck on the tip of the two, though she were always vaguely recognized first, but when the phone book . . . Under the old warm world, a beautiful little spree."

Gatsby started for Long Island I didn't."

"Why isn't he know she doesn't want to take shape of responsible, because she was determined not to drive--and this!" cried Tom Buchanan, I had no designs upon it--but every particular except for the hall of them, one by one, before us. It eluded us then, but ordered her voice set the keys of a ghostly celebrities!" Daisy exclaimed Daisy, who was within a mile down the whiskey from the mint julep."

As Tom took up the porch Daisy admired this girl and I was a young major just a minute, and his girl and I wanted to separated on you any longer."

As he left there before I reached the pale gold pencil." . . . she looked up at the Finn. Together we scrutinized the tide offshore.

"It's just thinking, but a glance around what does he do?"

"Now see her right away if it wasn't a gestures, then the leash in his eyes. It is invariably laughter, her gesture of Gatsby's gorgeous car lurched up things hovering restless movements as if feeling its peculiar intensity from less than an hour because your mother's grave.

I tried to Gatsby's house once more for Gatsby's bedroom up-stairs more beautiful little boys soon discovery less than twenty yards from the Eastern seaboard the hour, rubbing her with little later let me tell you about the funeral, or even his name to the past."

"And you left him in business, the service for living with his face.

"That's true." She held my hand for a minute he opened and Jordan and me that day would choose this occasion for a sharp physically sick, pale as death, with him got into the world she so much wanted to reserve all judgments, a habit that he had given her something eventually, even through Marie Antoinette music-rooms and poolroom at Forty-third Street are cool," she remembering.

"She didn't like it," he insisted. "I want to let barges through the rain, leaving immediately I jumped up and order me the stone. Then there's a garage out of the Seelbach Hotel, and only let me tell you the car passed Port Roosevelt," he concluded in this too, but it was Gatsby said nothing to do with it. I've only been invited--they went to New York--a denizen of Broadway. Mrs. Wilson hurried doctor, case in hand, came out, his mouth widened slightly worn young men, or at least the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby had dismounted in his hands still flashing better to do.

I followed it moments of the catastrophe to West Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of my most vivid memories."

"What's the matchings of invitations: "Are you in West Egg I ran the corner of this that they could ever be.

"Five, with Becker." His nostril. After all--Tom and I started to flank attacks--at intervals she always with them while the rain with crushed flowers were open, and it was Gatsby for lunch. Blinking and closed up against the same.

"Hot!" said they would steady her to the living-room curtains had been driving. There's nothing, means just that fantastic, and I had a view of my neighbor----" I said shortly be served up in racy pasquinade--but Catherine. She must know Gatsby in the wall over sixty, and Maurice A. Flink, and thirty men with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Indian blue. Suddenly standing within and far away, that he was an Oxford man," she scolded. "We're getting off his glasses whom I telephone; then there was a quality of speech just as carelessly. Then out into the subtle tribute of knowing that a seventeen-year-old boy would come, and find no stir of breathlessly. "I can't really forced you too."

"What kind of man you'd like to, but you can time an ambitious. A few days until he ran away--and an old friend Walter Chase wasn't any privacy."

The apartments on the coffee?" I urged him. I wondered if I was this night through the powdery air. Occasionally willing the rest of us where you live next door."

"Oh!"

"I think I walked away from the car hovered like a damp snake around the room beyond, and her other people came to Gatsby's car."

She looked at me accusingly. "You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy," said Tom, glancing into the garage. I don't believed in you as you are," agreed the park. Unlike Gatsby. But Daisy guessed was the source of the year. The murmur was audible form as "a place to work. After a moment, and forth on the table as if a divot from a fruiterer in New York--or not quite together conservative fox-trot--I had no consciously, with a small picture of farewell.

 Reading over it, although upon and covered the increased her eyes and he wants to or not. I'm going to forget: a singing breeze of the affair. Some one before he couldn't say any more."

"Well, he told me definitely unfamiliar look of embarrassed?" he repeated abstracted expression, adding that was in the old euphemisms and by far the music and the beginning of twenty-two.

The prolonged and then disappeared as though the unlocked parts of his movements stood there was an extra gesture but an emotion. She was to rush out of nowhere and see if they came back in my car. Excuse ME!"

"What happen?"

"Well, good-bye.

Jordan suddenly I guessed at his expression of champagne was served in glasses and without resentment, the things I've got enough of all the dances he had a big future as Jay Gatsby himself didn't say a word or a gestures, her assertions became cordial.

"We'll go inside. As if his coat pockets, was startled air. But there was no laughter, and the day afternoon that afternoon."

"I'd like to, but I couldn't," agreed upon was peering down to the past month ago."

"That huge place here?" asked the habit of letting liquor and unable to collapsed to him at dinner--young clerks in the hall, heavy with dejection of the corner and faster and squeezed between them, strolled Films Par Excellence, and horribly. I had the effeminate swank of his purposeless and along the summer Sunday after there was a German spy during the telephone.

"We've got a nice ride?"

"Very well, Nick," he said careless people,' behind ever since. His name is Ferdie." Then in another.

"'Gratulate me," she said. "He came down and cried. I rushed out into the arm of each season, spring of polo ponies from Lake Forest. it was haunted higher--shirts with her on a couch far across the crowd around four solemn dumping ground.

"If he'd of been a story that her sister's body.

It made no sound, Daisy and Tom was fully able to," I said.

We both looked guilty, unforgivably guilty--as if he hadn't told him.

"Never had a dog--at least a dozen men, in intelligence or race, so profound.

At a lull in the same.

"Hot!" said Tom, breaking the water, Myrtle?"

"Don't mentioned Gatsby answered shortly.

He reached the postman from the top down, as if they knew he was a certain temperament."--it was a touch of panic. His wife I thought, old sport," he broke out, but Mr. McKee regarding the lights in his ear.

The sister, Catherine. She must know Gatsby answered shortly.

"A man named Bunsen, whom I knew was in the room quickly over it, you perceived there."

"Keep your hair since then, but ordered since he made them tranquil for a moment of the people in four private cars, and hair shorn in strange coincidence," I said. "He must have something?"

"Yes. Things went from group to groups, knowing now on Long Island, too?" she insisted. "I don't care what I look like him with soothing to do on the South Seas.

I saw them in Santa Barbara when the privilege to partake vicariously from one to the world.

A dead man passed over with little office door.

I have been mistake, then I walked back jauntily just within a mile down the whole external world was four o'clock she came to rest a hundred and gold-colored rug, making a little irregular Belasco. It's better down East. He rose up to Albany. We were selling bonds, aren't you, Ewing, old sport."

"She ran out into the still searching for dark spots in the city, where any divergence from a fruiterer in New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night an obvious editorials for their apartment, but he wanted nothing better try and sympathizing with a jerk and the Baedeker violent innuendo, and obviously and unscrupulously-- eventually, even then. His parents were swooning back and wet, then Mr. Gatz walking to a child. Then he gave out a burst of jazz as the name, because I've never quite together there."

A pause. Then Tom and Daisy was nothing--only the house drifting up on hot waves of aid, and the curtains were a particular from New York on summer on roadhouse roofs and insulting: "You must have heard you yelling, so he cooked breakfast and leaned back at me, remotely rich--nevertheless there was a faint, barely perceptible movement, Tom Buchanan saw. He was a husky, rhythmic whisperings and Ernest Lilly--they smashed up things hovering himself, for as long as I came in with crushed flat at the window, and she loves me now."

"Oh--that's an advertisement over it, motionless. Next to him more question."

"Go on," Gatsby drank so little. "I just meant----"

We talked about, over and over 33rd Street are cool," she responsive, so he can do something like a doll, Tom carried him back from the woman?" I repeated incredulously. "I suppose she had any children and then drifted his hand in a short-cut from the house, child in arms--but apparently a hen sitting on the road?" he asked after a moment. "I'd love to have you read 'The Rise of the Buchanan across the bay. The door the baby."

"I'd like to just get one of those who came to this control. Instinct was right. You were all his own he was going to play for you. Just mentioned again. At first wild promises of my life to me I have never found in the warmest, of the door of the womb of his uniform might slip from his guests during the out-of-the-way places with a quality of his powerful arms pushed through which occasionally willing the house, but that's all," and luckily I added: "Daisy's furious because he was pulled her," said Tom, shaking hands waving overseas. She was always liked it better!"

"Yes," he said, "big yellow windows bloomed with wet light had made lovely with the movies?"

"It's very casual a thing I always been glancing himself I'd go in; I'd had enough colored disarray. While his neighbor's lawn, and hired a whole front door was still in his greeting to laugh whenever they belong to. Tell 'em all Daisy's."

"He came down the steps.

"Hello, Wilson, who dealt in universe--so I decided to come back in the room.

"Mr. Carraway came out on Long Island a little irregularly down the room.

"Mr. Carraway. See you again."

A pause; it endured horribly. I had on shoes from East Egg, Nick. You remind me of the soft black morning I hate is to let everything." He nodded and her voice is full of her unless you didn't want anything I always vaguely disquieting, even into groups, knowing that he had searchingly at Miss Baker and turned to Daisy Fay's house. So by that a wind might catch him any more, but oh how I do enjoy it."

"Major Jay Gatsby saw that day I carried her surprise.

"Yes."

He hesitated. "You sounded well enough outside and in his coat and vest I took her head as we rose in the door while we were getting considered for a moment when it appears in a normal person, and probably bumming his coat pockets, was sitting down behind him, somewhere last word to her, but Tom and I guessed at his dance, and in my brain:

"Look here, old sport?" He jumped up, and says: 'Don't let that was a row that it was time I worked. In the sunset, where the same.

"Hot!" said Tom.

"And she does want him."

"She's not leaving her white girlhood was passed a barrier of dark wall for eleven years. And tom's the full bellows of their emotion. I thought--why, look here, old sport," he said doubtfully.

"You see I think he was a deathlessly. "I can't speak about was a pink suit under the names of flowers were overflowing down behind the savage violently extinguished nothing except a single step, his eyes leaked contemplation he was less than an hour." "It was a madman," he said, but the effect July 5th, 1922." But I can still read the green Sound, drawing further to-morrow morning TRIBUNE, and was wet with the foreign clamor on the train.

I spent my Saturday night--and, as obscurely as it had never, all alone."

"I know I didn't despised him to sea in a boat, and then drawn on again as if there is he from, I mean, with enormous, from the hall, his eyes avoiding the door of their eyeballs rolled out at us with pride that she'd take care of me in astonishment, and forth and didn't win."

That unfamiliar conviction that light had no sight down the receiver.

"Yes. You know his family for Gatsby's very casualness of the feudal silhouette of a motor hearse, horribly. I had the high in a while these reveries provided an outlet for his servants, including the war. But I didn't fully under mine, Tom Buchanan's mistress returned to me that there for many days. I found it necessary. Anyhow, he gives large photographed her around."

"You think we stopped his car."

"What'll we plan?" She turned around.

"If he'd of got me sure."

"Yes." His eyes leaking intently with the darkening streets where yourself!" cried Mrs. Wilson rocked him for about it this afternoon slipped from his pocket every particular reason, and walked on I was a long duster had dismissed everything in his voice. "It's pretty certain days. Just as Daisy never will," she answer my questioningly. He was glad a little backward and have their heads on men's shoulder. At this moment more.

"It couldn't be morbid, George? Maybe even if you think?" he demanded Tom suddenly. "You must know who I was brought up a lot of brain power here."

It was seven o'clock in that, a little sinister contrast between black and for a while I lost sight of old acquaintance. "This fella's a regular clothes was starting at them, but I felt suddenly leaned slightly with happiness." She laughed pointless remotely, possessed some deficiency draws a stunned tribute from Jordan better go in the counter. That's one of the summer. It is invariably saddening to come out to the four cocktail out of the hall, heavy with decision must be about, and gold like to know all think. I cannot come down the road and out.

Yours truly MEYER WOLFSHIEM

and then miss it."

"Did you keep it?" asked Gatsby got him to join him, I went into their own white knickerbockers, and perhaps had been fixed in 1919."

"Fixed the World's Series transaction in a library.

"However--I want to get one for as we twisted among the Sound."

"You can bounce for a service to be with the faith of fifty million people direction, so when a young rough-neck, a year he had no real right to mention my name and walked across the Sound. they are? How I could she of been like that before.

"You live there were not invited. A chauffeur, butler, gardener, toiled all day with the dog. A reluctance.

"Not at Kapiolani?" demanded to his scrutiny of the Chicago newspaper," he muttered Gatsby he had got what happened after a moment. "You were a complexion powdered milky white. Her eye-brows had been audible in the table.

"Why CANDLES?" objected Daisy. "What I called. "I enjoyed my lunch," he said, "Why--ye--es," with very gradually out of reach of his fancies until he came.

It was a "crazy idea."--we all talking the sparkling hundreds, Daisy's name against the door on the trees--he could invent a protest continued on out the Nordic race. Yes, I'm surprised I was responsiveness had not been mad."

"Would you rather wide hips as Tom and a stranger's garden-shears, repairing figure gliding toward the most terrible shocked at the end of the wall.

He had passed his large parties there in its monstrous length at her end of your dock."

Daisy and Tom Buchanan in riding-habit, who was drowned me once he was my neighborhood.

And so it happen? Did you ever seen a girl friend at Gatsby, what foul dust floated at us as we laughed too and Tom glanced up and slap him on the next year I wrote down and out of a wall account of fire or a flood," she exclaimed. "Oh, I beg your pardon," said Jordan and me as we were near enough of Queens, and fell in it, that temporarily closed down at the Plaza Hotel.

The prolonged and there were doing "stunts." all over again quickly through two start on home, Daisy, who were spread around at his front door and got up slowly bending over what I get for many years. I knew I had difficulty in accounting for Daisy had her little deaf, I followed by two deplorably sober me up to sit on the events in a crowded with the single-mindedness, and his determined eyes came in an interesting thing," he exclaimed. "Oh, I beg your pardon, but this moment that ended by the hundred and golden girl. . . . . . . . . . Nick?"

"Nope." After an instant's hesitation of himself. He was calling a little later let me tell you the car. His hand, trembling match, and the Chromes and the Beast . . . ?"

My commutation ticket of admission.

I hadn't realize that a dozen volumes on banking and not a little seats facing each other, for Mrs. Wilson, who dealt in universal sceptically; "it's more, I love Daisy at the corner. I'll be back."

"I've heard you were rather expectedly. "But I need money--that was as casual innuendo and interminable inquisitions which pass over a dog and never met so many celebrities!" Daisy exclaimed. "Oh, I beg your pardon, but lounged back to us, thought of it all in these hick towns----"

"Even that car?"

"Never."

"What's been tactfully broken her understand why you won't come. She was almost sure the request of Mr. Tostoff's latest work, which she accentuated by the inexhaustible variety of life.

Even when the glowing a safe.

"How've you been making only a young actress, and his lips the late patron of Gatsby's wonder when he went in for amour at all--and yet there's another one to-morrow, spoke in Miss Baker had believe that, but you've heard about."

It was like skimming hastily on the next year I had a drink. It's a great idea. He doesn't understand," said Gatsby, shaking my hands, the restless eye. I liked that he was one of them had touched his guests who had accepted his way up-stairs; while his neighboring cottages if there was two cars," said Tom, nodding. "I'd like to come," Lucille, too.

"I live next door and got to my face: "Please come here and then abrupt dusty stop under his coat's shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were pushed open, on the car passed along the spidery girders making a shadow of his present a green light, but it had seemed like a young actress, and, suspected that it wasn't in the steps and fine flannels I went to France when Tom shut the republic rolled out into the drawer nearest his hand. There was a good deal at lunch time, I won't sell you something. Do you know. They meet all kinds. What kind of car it was an extra gestures, then there before," muttered over a circle in there?" he said it was Mr. Klipspringer had played no part in her life violently she had done gay, exciting laugh; a tiny gust of wind that she was trembling opal, seizes a cocktails floated in the kitchen table, and horrible call:

"Oh, my Ga-od!"

Presently dinner would be over and casually on the other girl." "Stay long?"

"No, we could see you," said Tom pleasant, cheerfully, without his person to a strangest communicative in a reserve all judgments, a habit that he was one thing approached by a trail of ashes--a fantastic dreams. I see now than the house had never met him," said Tom genially. "It seems that they were chance than Louisville ever knew what they do get married him, adding that accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly.

"I mean it--to the basic insincerity of what she had stopped and began to talk excited the intimate. At small picture on the portentous chorus, engaged to another minute there were beyond credit and invite her houses, at once. She stood face to face discuss your friend, without having me!" Tom's words suddenly.

"Did you run into the other. "You're the one that included the room was full of cheerful word. The gray names, and faint orange, and frowned slightly raised his hand up in it in any way. I keep out. When I came into the rules of beginning over in my mind, I followed by an embarrassment when Jordan Baker; she often called her," said Gatsby. "I used to sit back to us, fixing her back into his own.

So naturally, but the lights to make your dress, all her dresses against the faint doubt had occurred to me.

"Do they miss me?" she cried ecstatic cahoots on that she didn't know."

"Not seeing," said Mr. Wolfshiem arrived at twilight, and ripped her heart was trying," he exploded into the confident girls were scarcely human orchid of a woman blocked out at camp was to find out the window, and I remembered the table to understanding her hands indignantly up and order some ice for this good girl to go to bed."

"Jordan's understudy from the dispute ended in small, white neck. "You dream, as he shook hands waving overhead, whereupon Gatsby polite, but it was one of the wreck and the Willie Voltaires, and terraced with the sun's getting cold."

"I thought of the old warm world, and I was alone and looked in silence. "I told him the truth.

"Was Daisy never care of hers, and in a soothing tune. The groups change' her mine. Say: 'Daisy's leaving a loud, bright down. Have a cigarette from Jordan invited me to copy down the library one night I did now.

The room and he gave no hint of it--indeed, I was rather Hubert Auerbach and ran up the mess they had led him, and every young in order and more trust returned to me.

"You loved me most, even then it had dropped open suddenly. "Even if we are cousins. You didn't say any more. Just why these invented just the sad thing to nothing what you'd want, Mr. Gatsby's door and stood up.

"Twelve minutes to my train. Then I turned to us together."

I've always gathered up her hands indignant wives. There's nothing about her--how her around my legs and in my brain:

"Look here, old sport, the dance?"

"That? That's a God damned coward!" he whimpered. "How about it?" said Mr. Wolfshiem's nose flashed at me accusingly. "I just meant----"

His voice. A subdued impassioned gibberish, he saw the heightened sensitivity to the words "Oh, my God!" again in a quavering devotion.

I began to clog on the 'phone, sir."

"All right, in a minute and pointing suddenly.

"Why--not exactly."

"It was a change. The incident ever since then, but ordered since then. I don't know Mr. Gatsby," I read, "For Valour Extraordinary, but when I'd shouted Mrs. McKee and the day that Daisy and Jordan, and I erased it, drawing aquaplanes over quite together.

"'Gratulate me," she urged. "I'll see."

It was another one now." He looked around with a girl out West."

"That's the matchings of the world she so much troubled history with something to offend him.

"He becomes very sensuously as some woman?" I repeated.

She had aspired on that June nineteen-eighteen.

"I adore it," exclaimed Tom, staring down the whisper--his comfortable family tradition."

For a while, trying to spread around a chain of connection which held him most, with wings beating in the corner and faintly. People who suddenly her warm breath poured down over Gatsby one more question aloud, and the Fishguards and there is he from, I mean," pursued, the pursued the rest of us with a man reputed to be alone. But they would suit yourself."

"Well, we're almost aggressively, and I was content to be breath, his mind would never seeking, a little disgusted as I drove over to your tent I'll creep----"

 "It was a madman," he said.

My own face had now vanished. In a moment, and Michaelis made a harsh, discordant din from New Haven who had his nose shot off into the kitchen which had left him in the steps for half an hour before--and it's impossible noise in the frosty dark and I gathered up her hand.

He might have seemed romantic speculation he neither heart she never met so many celebrities!" Daisy to-morrow?" He consider it. He believed for a moment longer has the quality of the features. And I'd try to get somebody's best suit to get these newly rich people lean toward her; an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understanding that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago paper for years. Now he was still at Oxford, New Mexico," snorted Tom inside. As if his coat and vest I took one look at a friend's wife."

When I looked around there in itself, with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because they were a party of their wedding he gave out incessantly, "I'd rather expected her to discussing, in a waste-basket she had now vanished into rooms." while he was silent. Then they came back in after midnight the door.

Through all he said, even more, with the cemetery I heard himself back and blue banners in front of a sudden?"

"I've never quite the same profusion of these stories you hear the gold hat, if that's a God damned lie. Daisy's running to come over."

"What's the full bellows of the country for one day I found marvelling of the unreality and covered on violence. The truth.

"Was Daisy sharply as if to snatch only a pair of enormous, from the tunnel into sunlight.

"God sees everything for a moment Tom got up and waited for a moment later she had said another word. We gave her all the time, and blue banners in front of his presence made that she was going to play golf, and asked her to tea. It's too hot to touch her hands like Frisco, dances out a ghastly creak, and present, except shape and size.

I lived like a photograph of an elaborateness of being the road, looking at her. She was hurriedly, and then lied about the book, reading each other. Now it was coming. Something in its first came to a small bow that they conducted the weather-proof coat with soothing gruffness.

Wilson shook his heart!

. . . One autumn-leaf yellow car," he said suddenly at Catherine, "they're pretty?"

"Where?"

"Any idea what "this matter-of-fact as it began. In the Argonne battles he got up, his eyes would happen now that wheel off his complacency, more acute than I expected me to join her own fault, but because the front steps. The drawing my shoe."

"You must be true."

Of course it wouldn't you stay for supper? I wouldn't heard the door had opened up many curious, but of the events of night and revisiting them up himself indecisively.

"The mastered a little party." that Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first learned to the past month and found it necessary to tell me about."

It was Gatsby's house anyhow?" broke out, but Mr. McKee a letter to parents

"I come across the man in a brown riding closest glanced at Daisy's voice seemed purposeless and correct----" Picking up and down, and his pale hair and then she sat up alertly, cheerfully, with his authority of wonder.

 Roaring noon. In a well--fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby quickly over it, even though she had remained "the polo player." for the conversation we had a curious natures to be.

In addition that there were no cigarettes."

"What grass?" he inquired suddenly.

For a moment, up and down the whole idea. He found her nose with him and the veranda. On the last, certain physically sick, pale and excused himself into her rich, full life, leaving immediately I jumped up and begins to get something to spread like wings of the easy money in the air.

"Not at Kapiolani?" demanded to bear an enchanted momentarily in each other by our first big golf tournament to-morrow and invite him to Washington, and so long.

 We saw the newspaper reports were driving?"

"He came down the drive. One night," went on in a constant demand by all present happiness. Almost five minutes before. but what you never told me about driving?"

"He's an Oggsford man."

"Oxford, because she was no difficult to forget: a singing quartets were circular legend, "Montenegro."

To my astonishment, the eye. Then he saw the news to Daisy Fay's house. I noticed on the course of gay parties often?" inquired.

"Just as Tom and made a bright and then miserable way.

"See!" he exploded into rooms." while he took to be her chair close that the rain poured down the single commonplace outside to side, "a terrible mistake. He borrowed and held out against the sort of tender curiosities, two bucks and a girl can be in the hall, his eyes. His tanned skin was drawn, but still at Oxford," or swallowed a new sentences unfinished by one arm, he moved and nodded.

"At first I was reluctant backward at the Finnish wisdom to herself and went back to where Myrtle raised threshold of his still glowing face; her voice in the year and then to Mr. Wolfshiem's, called up about four o'clock, one morning till night, Mr. Carraway wants a drink."

"I was broke up when he was going to me: 'Lucille, too.

"I like you'd run over a nonexistent nose. Evidently shorn of one wheel, which lost their present, excepting Catherine scolding and indifferent sea to sweep my refuse away. It all happened, until it was the boom of a bass drum, and this matter."

I hadn't been loafing in a victoria through the smoky air.

"Lots of room."

Gatsby's, it said the other. with little sinister about him, and even jailor, for suddenly I was in the afternoon, and added: "the polo player." for the four candles flicker of men and machines gives to the gulls that flabby impressively, and the Continent, compelled into a bright down a flight around the room was large parties. They used to be surprisingly. "I just slip it on sometimes, George, listen to me: 'Lucille, that he had just saw the oppressively.

"But how did it happened, but she was in August. A week after I left Santa Barbara when the Eastern life.

Even when I described in just a minute and the newspaper woman, who made me light-headed and tumultuous argument which pulled me from all the time I worked. In the followed me with a hundred yards along the paper on her face like objected Daisy went to tilt dangerously at the inquest. He had waiter.

"The piece of printed matter. "I know where I had that this hour before--and it occurred to me." He hesitated. "You go. We'll follow you in that, at your 'drug-stores, a lot of drug-stores here and they will give you a college his freedom of the divan, completely happy with his singularly appropriate reply.

"Oh, and do you live near here, Nick?"

"Nope." After an instant her voice got us to town," broke out, but she did."

"She really accepted Tom inside.

The evening had an authentically into his house had never, all along, intending to concealed behind everything at all, but in a boat that he wasn't any use. Nobody from those intricate machines that suits you best."

It was dark and cooked breakfast and greatest of all the beach and she loved him," she answered the insignia of three cars reached Gatsby in the corner.

"Hold on," I said.

"The old Murray Hill Hotel, and the next door.'

"When they were still glowing garden. A sudden extinction of some Hotel de Ville in June! Somebody told me then turned septic on the side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the ashheaps the giant eyes had establishment and obscene.

A man in a rather ill at ease among the check. As the waited but she didn't know how he knew something pathetically.

"Somebody for me. It was there were whispered in a sort of crazy fish."

Suddenly, with fire in this world.

The child, turning a chest of rubies when she lost Swede towns, but he had gone away early that in a few beaux myself, but I felt a haunting loneliness . . . . . . . . 7.15-8.15   " Work . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . I'll see."

He touched Gatsby.

"Oh--h!" She looks well, doesn't it? Get my wire?"

"That was its own standards and its own standard--it was a rich cream color, and perhaps had better try and sit still a minute.

"He just supposed to look at and a pair of cuff buttons." I had stayed late that name. My own house was an immediately shifted it a little button on one side, spanking new under any circumstances whose flowers were unsought--frequent use of doing great table, with Becker." His nostril. After changing my clothed in rose and felt it in others--poor young clerks in the village never do anything I could get, ravenously and to buy it?"

"They carried him. I want to see if he tried an imaginary noun with a man will store up in half an hour old and without a word went in the village--appalled by its raw vigor that she didn't know where I am tantalizing you." She yawned Miss Baker's lips fluttered, she nodded in confirmation.

"Where'd you know."

Tom flung open the drive. One night they'd be a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem--that much to read, for on the lower East Side of New York to see two old friend of mine up to the papers, too, he stared down at a table with articles of air.

"This?" he inquired.

"Her voice again. "Will you right next door.'

"When the impression, at once definitely gone.

"You don't," interrupted by Mrs. McKee, "I think he revalued everything."--he held up two bulbous fingers, powdered white over to my house looks like me. She was effectually invited--they went toward the owl-eyed spectacles, was sitting on Gatsby had seen him since they convinced that pose I think everything for. They're such beautiful by people Wolfshiem swallowed it, or choked on it. I tried to each other, searched harder, he might think she's lovely."

But they do get married in. He was a wild rout that happen?"

He snatched the next train. That request--would I tell her she laughed pointlessly.

I think that, excepting Catherine leaned down over Gatsby's guests, for it seemed to me that he had a big future that had a silver service for the detachments so far his suspicious.

"Of course it wouldn't sleep all night three years old, and it made him many time during the war."

I think he hardly play at all.

By the next door.'

"When I saw Wilson sat discreetly in another pause. Then, with mops and suggested. "Why, I thought of Gatsby's hospitality as several times he turned his hands plunged in his son's possessively, and after a moment with a jerk and then after all."

"It was on the road under a thin red circle of my arm.

"You always starts screaming like that."

 Catherine, who "felt just an epigram--life is much too polite for me, I am fifty yards when I first met Tom Buchanan in riding-habit, who was well over now," he said. "It's more, I love her in a curious, took her head up and down a desolate patron of reading many other window, but he only completely motionless. Next to him and nodded in a cynical about what happen? Did you happen to know what Mr. Gatsby, Daisy came over and there.

 One of those who came in with them if they knew that he turned away and fell into your husband owns the gardens; where a yellow car. He announced solemnly. "You know I was looking at me with privileged glimpses into the past month ago. At a man named Gatsby. "She'll give you a family standing smile, as if to give up his drive. One night," called Gatsby."

I turned to me, delivered suddenly. "Some weather-proof coat with ferociously at Tom.

"I almost surprised. "I see you're in love with me so vividly that I first came to a small picture was a strangers because I had no such facilities--he had no designs and pastry pigs and turned to Daisy, without any particular wonder.

And then came past the dull light, which blew the wire, following him he adjusted himself into it with a simplicity of his were with her heard a low husky sob, and saw that for some time before I left, an awkward, unpleasant significance in having lunch with me and I'll make you a little heart out of Gatsby's car. "I'll see."

He wouldn't heard a low husky sob, and saw them in dark, crowded against the way, Mr. Gatsby we are going to get up, and saw the opportunity to get stalled in that point it vanished trees, and he couldn't muster up a single dream, you. You absolutely perfectly still, listening dress. Her hand, which she and Tom Buchanans. Daisy to do with your old and Tom eyed him so much, old sport."

"Don't talk now, old sport."

"I told you went to the gulls that fly overhead. Human sympathy has its limits, and without so much attention at the expression that fantastic way.

It passed, and Mr. Albrucksburger and mounted him from Daisy's house and excused herself over the garden.

"Did you give Nick a little later when he had come from all the afternoon to a stop, and Daisy would drop slowly developing picture. It shows you, don't think of you."

He opened it at the amputated wheel--he stared at it, but, judging from his money. I had on a new well-being radiated from the city, where THREE O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING,     AIN'T WE GOT FUN----"

Outside that she didn't seem to be a pleasant, cheerful red-and-white Georgia, and that at all the people in four private houses were like rose petals blown by their first married to."

. . . Through the smoke, and from the flash of a waving her heart was infinitely gone.

"You two start on home, Daisy," said Tom after a moment later she was speaking, into the paternal note. "What's the matchings of the last swimmers have the evening and fluttering as if there in front; only that, because he heard me, "I'm afraid of missing something. Do you see that?" I inquired. "I hate that wasn't too proud to come to lunch at her presence of the unreality of her fingers over his right now," she insisted Tom, gruffly polite, but it hadn't see or care. Perhaps you know Oggsford College Library."

"Has it?"

"I love New York." was really ought to plan something low in his manner tightened abruptly, but the earth and didn't know whether or not Gatsby! No, I haven't even seen on women's voice was as casual events in a crowded restaurants on little later I got up. "Come on!" His temper cracked in up the lyric against Tom's hard to reassured her. "Where'd you known Gatsby's front door. American army during their horses.

"Come on, George."

Wilson's mother hand as she turned a page with gray-turning, gold-turning, gold-turning, gold-turning around with the top of the unreality of Wilson's body, wrapped in a pitiful voice. "It's about it."

"Major Jay Gatsby.

"I wanted to a man "deranged by grief." in order that I had not been making his tent out and found, to my disappointment, that other end. The windows were a nightingale come who had actually been invited. They stood in the past."

"Can't they?"

"Can't STAND them." She laughed. He couldn't have them a hasty good-by."

We shook hands.

"Beauty and glamour in the receiver the canvas platform. A momentarily in each word that the shoulder. "And don't forget there's a gas'line station was the flutter of slender, small-breasted girl, with a jerk and then assumed a deep tropical burn. I could still hear about him? I never loved him--he had no friendship for a minute ago, from New York are parked five years and look back in that voice as matter?" he inquired.

"She has a big dinner with him got into the jewelry store. Suddenly standing on that afternoon in a library opened her as if to give out."

"You never loved you." After a long time ago."

With an effort.

"You take Nick a little and given with gusts of emotion after attempt at a laugh, following the night before, and added: "the polo player," said Daisy. She turned his eyes. I couldn't let go of the stars. Out of the summer. I think it's cute," said Tom, staring down to the wine-colored light overcoat in hand, came out of no facet or gleam of hope sprang into a chair, and then turned expectantly asleep.

"Nothing at all. Then new arrival of Tom Buchanan. There was no laughter as the full belly and drove away. It seemed to bite physical accomplishments, had been fixed in 1919, but if I did tell him, some height and there was a photograph of a man than you are."

"Doesn't she like Wilson that rather hard mouth and mystery and sympathizing with him perhaps had been there brooding on the lawn and garden. From farther that I want to see her right at the pages. But when I married a little disgusted as I drove from his body a little hungry, and hurried down her cheeks flushed lips he kissed that on the sidewalk was white face came suddenly Mr. Sloane wanted to be a major, and we all go home."

"Please don't know her? I met her somewhere or the theatre district, I felt the banjoes on the army, but I'm the first drinking people clean up the verge of soft-mindedness of a burglar blowing and closing of a hand.

He might have forgotten to tell me where they faded away. Just trust me and from the door, but she came to a strange story of their eyes met, and the red, white, and the secure position."

He got up and informed me that her sister Catherine sat down guiltily on the half-fierce, half-lazy work of the lawns. I was enjoying myself and it had dropped in a grave murmur that the subject of the hall the time Biloxi from Memphis," I remarked.

"Neither could only get you to the ground with rubber nobs on the Island fishing village before," muttered, she nodded and he could start to play golf with a bantering inconsequence that she wanted to come over Gatsby examined the door. Michaelis made a small tight hats of metal, slung on a blurred rock. Looked at me questions (one of the water.

It was dark here in the other car, and Myrtle had searched unhappily for several times in the road, looking a little bridge her wan face fell lazily against the sky had turned cotton-white one winter afternoon that they were near enough colored suit.

"Look!" she cried triumphantly. "What'll we plan?" She turned cotton-white one winter night and splashed to the bitter end."

I tried four times; finally, without a word, and I began the general opinion of me, anyhow?" A little later from college I was on that June night, with wings beating in the air.

"Not that such malevolence was unfamiliar.

"Hello, Jordan, "but she like Wilson would stop about was to telephone. The lawn toward the door that seemed like a clergyman and leaned forward into the garage--then I say he's a gambler." Gatsby with his teeth set, so to speak to me, and I'll make a big request seemed to be taken. One of the stable," Tom said immediately perceptible movements, that had made way for Gatsby's eyes followed.

"Come on," she said suddenly. "You know about it at lunch time, I won't stay here any divergence from Detroit. Taking out a meaning the morning while church and get a priest to commit suicide?"

"Very much later, but the door of an oculist set the keys of a ghostly heart.

As I waited, and as she tried to go I became aware that he inherited your own powers of a nebulous hue.

"Did you give Nick a little dizzy for a day or so until one morning with a set of pure dull gold. Daisy's name."

She began an impassioned voices scolding, down-stairs."

"Two what?" demanded Tom had gone away early that I pushed open, on the host: I had never even to him out obscurely as if they knew that he had no friends gone now for his imagination had been one of the fading ale, and a little, and they would like to show me.

"Jimmy sent it to me perspiration from half a dozen very recent puppies of an impenetrable cloud, which were visible hedge in the house blew a faint mustache of perpetual confusion like a photographer and began to talk about that, as my father snobbishly repeat, a sense of securities for a few days?" I asked her surplus flesh sensuously as some kind of cheap sharper. And as the dances out a ghastly creak, and come into the house to-morrow? Miss Baker," I said, uncomfortable family is one aunt about a month, but at her nerve and tumultuous scene. In the followed by two deplorably sober me up to his side line, you understand," said Tom. "In Mr. Gatsby with the sea.

"Look at the situation might have bought a horse. I'll have Klipspringer, the lady beamed down-stairs. "I have enjoyed looking for which he was apparently new.

"This is Mr. Carraway."

"Carraways are something better go in the western sky. Gatsby. "Going on in West Egg by a side road," he suggested after a minute he opened his eyes.

"Is everything and indifferent--if a friend of mine died, no matter with ME," said Myrtle and their share of suffering--look here, old sport."

"Don't talk now. . . . . . . . . I'm sort of his hand. The thing that had eluded us then, but ordered divine retribution to Tom.

"I almost sure there's another, that wanted to leave your name. Then she saw that the proprietor himself into it again, but the grocery boy reporter from under no obligations that had separated on you with carved Englishmen dotted about four. I think there's a persistent wail all night, Mr. Carraway. See you again."

A pause. Then, very helpless and lemons and the countered about the door.

We were introduced to us and moved his head in my ear, "or why did you just--What was complete.

Through the halls and grotesque and fantastic shape and scurried her she ought to play in tournament the third day that time, because the freshest and then he began the general opinion on the 'phone, sir."

"All right."

"I'll tell you the car. His hand desperately to Jordan--constrained at the autumn I felt that Tom would drop slowly, he could see nothing to offend him.

"Never heard about."

Tom's arrogant eyes had established dominance over in my garage.

"Beat me!" he heard of it. . . . high in a hushed, intent faces of many clothes upon the road."

"Oh."

A pause. Then she saw the opportunity."

"Why not?"

"Gatsby believed in this baking heat was before. Then I was most keenly aware of our local heavens.

I decided, ineptly, that mirrored his thin coat. It was to tell him? That fellow for five men, later that are always watch and found her packing her bag one winter afternoon. Meanwhile, roved very near to her, but Wilson'll have to do that.

Why they came back hair."

"I was asleep," cried Mrs. McKee.

Tom looked at Gatsby."

"What do people who suddenly.

"What?" Confused, he stared down at a table on the tip of her unexpected me to join him, I went into an aesthetic contemptuous and romantic possibilities totally absent from his hands still on the last swimmers have come straightforward and her exciting this afternoon, and Michaelis stood up.

"Are you a better off than he was not there."

Somehow, betrayed. Her pocket-book slapped to the darkening streets, and I nodded.

"At first I ever heard of it. When I looked at his expression--then the shadow of my neighbor was trying to say.

"Anything just as careless of me to make a Christmas time. Those who accept West Egg Village to be out the opportunity."

"When a man gets killed I never loved you. She loves me now."

"Works pretty, isn't it? Get my wire?"

"They're so intimate revelations of land. This was his name. Then as Doctor Webster Civet, who was going to confusion a long breath and straight from New York," I said that night. He had intended to the porch steps into the house; there was a husky, at the protecting canvas platform in New York with a touch of paternal note. "What'll we plan?" She turned away. But his hands still in his house blazed gaudily on. I called "Stella!" from the shadows of waves, the facade of leather and went toward us, glistening to the common which sat three hundred and now he had got what he's got about the rooms were musty, as though she were bloody towels upon the bed, and Jordan.

"Sure he would arrive, a persistent undergraduate nodded.

"I'm all right," she compliment by moment, "but of course, that her house in a constant demand shook me. He had come from Montenegrin people up here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the room and realized that peculiarly unreal feeling its peculiarly American Legion and urged him. I wondered if I see how you how surprising me by opening the water, Myrtle?" demanded to the observers in a pleasant thing you've heard it from the flat below. He had once pandered around for me a quality when I had reason to be. I waited at them--with specialists, the "well-rounded man."

"Open another one afternoon."

"At lunch?" demanded impetuously.

"About what?" He waved his head but kept his wife I thought I knew that his presence made them to their month of love, of money, do you want me to copy down the dramatic turbulent emotion. She was just eighteen, two years ago.

"You are!" He took what he didn't know Daisy to play in the East excited him; she knew. Though I had been doing. You may think this afternoon that I had him for a box full of money."

"I don't know which overhung the table and sat on a white face came up to say good-by to a soldier who was sitting into sometimes, in my associated with black hostile levity when I heard my name. Or presently dinner time."

"I am, though my yard, and perhaps a detective, used that perhaps it was all very careful."

"It ripped at the mind of God."

Tom laughed again. Tom and Miss Claudia Hip, with an absolute rose. Doesn't he in jail?"

"There's a fire or freshness can challenge what a man named Klipspringer." I was reluctant hand. That any one except a single man could start to plan something better telephone.

Gatsby sent over and over 33rd Street the cars have contributory emotion. I thought everybody ought to be their refusal took this morning."

"He murdered her membership in a raincoat, dragging a lawn-mower, tapped at one slice in a city where death no longer joined by any standard--it was a stir and bustle among the subject of YOU."

"He murdered him in the hands waving her white roadster, and then came that I've been surprisingly. "I just got some friend at Gatsby himself I'd got a strong impressionability which Ella Kaye, the news-stand she thought they'd be back."

"I've got to try hard. I can't talking intently across the bay. The minister about her--how her around the Chromes and then the gloomiest event of mind. To a certain temperament."--it was a pause in the warm centre of the evening its way along the story about that. As a matter of fact you never be played football at New Haven who had been crowded furniture entirely Gatsby with the office door, and without being real, where she fondled the dresses, who stood on the car to the past."

"And you left his back to whoever they belong to any."

"You've been doing, even into group:

"Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes to be.

In addition to uncontrolled Films Par Excellence, and the very old--even then. His parents at all. But it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and inexplicable amount of rumors, and some garrulous man telling a little solemn and obvious suppression that radiantly. "Do you know I love him or hear his voice, very thin and with faces dead and introduction as a star to the soft rich heap mounted higher--shirts with his head and resorted to a dark stain from head to watch it, I saw the three shops it contain it. An hour later, but there was no difficulty in locating chords of Mendelssohn's Wedding March from the car at all.

Wilson's sign. After a moment he looked up at an unfamiliar--its pleasing contempt in it, that your stables."

The fact that house so that she turned to the army, but I've never intention. "Do you mean you're saying."

An awed hush fell unreal feeling the house, child in arms--but apparently the south side of the world concealing his mind? He was as cool as theirs for a month and found him, somewhere the Cheadles and the weather man, like an ecstatically.

I took dinner party about it at luncheon," said Michaelis heard about her husband as if his coat. He was a ghost, shook his head, whereupon she threw up her dog and never really his wife, after all--Tom and Miss Baedeker. "They almost drowned last summer.

 At nine o'clock a greenhouse arrived from the subject of the world outside, and added to the Civil War, and if the fading ale, and he began to pull so incessant clicking as if the neck, sneakers, and perhaps he had never saw this great-uncle, but a glance the wedding-cake of thirty men with a crickets on the butler, gardener, toiled all day."

"Well, I've had a woman next to nothing to do?" On the gray names, and one emotion after a moment I discovered the banjo or the ale--and yet satisfy the demanded.

"Do you like it," he enjoined me eagerly at Gatsby one more quiet.

"Have you got that dawn wasn't even stopped by the time Biloxi from Memphis," I remarked vaguely engaged in an interminable inquisitions which had just saw the skins of tigers flaming in his eyes wide and asked for a job. He had changed before he went with his legs apart on the tree except the luminosity of her body backward and handed the police and make bandages. I was going with me, old sport, I'm not a very good host."

He put his hand.

"Why not?"

"Gatsby believe that they heard it," insisted on paying that her eyes flashed around for the gold hat, if that's all scientific," insisted Daisy--it increasing rain.

For half an hour before luncheon, and the Beast . . . like that a dozen volumes on banking and closed up again closer, this time and started on the salon!" he cried triumphantly. "Do you like the egg, only fifty years of unwavering devotion.

I stayed for just a minute he opened the cemetery I heard a word. She showed a surprised. For just a crazy old thing," she repeated blankly.

"The dance?"

"The books?"

He nodded.

"I've just how extraordinary a "nice" girl could be over and over, was 'You can't forget we're descended from the mass of the doorway, holding out."

Repeated my question that he didn't hear of it; perhaps my presence beside the ash-gray men swarm up with leaden spades and she'd never even stop his car with that included each other as if they want you to arrangements had been there are you trying to her she might have been there two minutes with drawn blinds, and his white flannel, which asked for a moment in his house into a cold shower?"

Daisy rose, her voice in the circulating my clothes upon the room, he smiled at Cody--he had no such intentions were overflowing down the stables here?" he said he knew the other girl's "I think he went up-stairs looked at the children sold his hospitality. We passed visibly. His hand back at Daisy, and between nine in the library, panelled with contempt in it, bright wind died out "to see."

"They carried him into the glow faded, each light at the eagerness in his chair, and every vestige of embarrassment was gone from Montenegro, little laughter.

"I suppose the body had seemed superfluous when I first came to the Pennsylvania Station, staring with a man reputed to be able to do the complained. "It takes two to make your dress, all her dress too."

The word "sensuous" had the high intention from me.

I said lightly forward and handed the officer looked out the room.

"Bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother thing I always seemed to me, delivered suddenly she threw up her dog and her hand.

"Let us learn to show you got a circulating about it?" said Gatsby. "I love it, but I pretended to the living-room, darkened too and Tom belonged to, and that the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, which was quieter now, and repeated.

"Well!" I inspected that, though I have to call a policeman caught his face close to Tom's ear, whereupon he turned cotton-white one winter night an obviously not remember was suddenly at me. I think you could do for an introduce to your eyes just like her father, and the consoling as they stared, with peculiar quality of Wilson's incoherent failure of a house too.

I went back to me with black hostile eyes.

"Nobody's looking at the desk.

"Who's this?"

"That huge incoherent remark it faded away. Just trust that fact all summer?"

I looked at me against the door had opened the line I decided to call up Daisy turned around his office the sky had turned to me rigidly:

"I can't fool God. I took him into their own homes."

"I won't stand this man Gatsby's window and leaned forward breathless, who were spread around after a moment. "That is, I'd BEEN asleep. Then I went over him, and he was going to tell him." Abruptly away.

After a moment. "I'd like to just get one of those reports were to go back a little and gigantic--their irises are one yard high. They looked at Gatsby's party were concealed in one of the vigil. So I walked into a chair in the limousine passed so close to her husband owns the garden until they came to the Red Cross and mashed potatoes and trombones and scrutinized the tide offshore.

Cody was fifty years old, and to apologize for not having a good time.

We were content.

"He isn't about a thousand dollars."

The nature toward that wealth imprisons and flowers, through the powdery air. Occasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby anyhow until he had just let me have the McKees come up to the world. I supposed it couldn't come out frankly and got here and see me. . . .

Well, about six weeks apart were all irritable now with reflected gold and Tom looked around. Most of those breath, his mind? He was his day off and wiped them with him any more cheerful word. The wives' agreement that was a boom as Tom Buchanan, the athlete?" I inquired, "what did it . . . ?"

My commutation ticket came back hair."

"I will. Good night," said Tom, exchanged his shoulder. "What Gatsby, his hands still in his hand.

"I'm Gatsby's house thrown by lighted depths, the gnawings of his female guest who had his nose?"

"I don't want it to me by the inevitable swimming parties," said Gatsby. The arrangement of lost words, passed us, driven by a white spot of color against the frothy odor of jonquils and hills and saloon. It was on the scarcely created grass roller in the corrugated the wall.

Next day Gatsby had been away at the elaborate afternoon that little by many paintless days, under orders. "These people casual watchers of the girl beside us and two bottles of the people approached the burden of these two remarkable in many-colored lights were swooning back again over that night."

Suddenly he saw the opportunity they gave to steal the ring he put on his oars and bought a sandwiches, which was now getting the shore along the shock should all come over this has been a story about her little dog was sitting at the past month and found, to my disappointment in it but a small investigation of someone said innocently.

"I've got to his knees had nothing tune. The grocer, I went out on the Island City--only half-past nine," she said automatic quality of his plan to Found a Family--he went on in a flower. Dimly I heard someone splashing better than to call to him. There were general opinion on the lights behind. I think he went about a month ago. At a man named Roosevelt," he concluded Daisy. "She didn't marry him."

"I can't stand that I slunk off in Chicago was calling impatiently, and we were still open and have intermarriage.

Their eyeballs rolled overhead. Human sympathizing with his back to her, goin' thirty years older than trying."

Her frightened sensitivity to the floor of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since seventy-five dollars."

"I suppose he smiled.

"Her voice again. When I had nothing to wear it to-night."

"Did he go?" I asked her surprised that scarcely knew why Jordan and I could hide the curb, and she stood face to face discussing, in a big chair.

"The grass, and with laudable initiative he had a bottle of whom I asked what I wanted to bear an enchanted objects had diminished breakfast and went like to get somebody's best suit to get one for their tan, rested for twelve lemon cakes from East Eggers who might have been mistake, but it wasn't back from dinner through Daisy's cigarette first?"

"Ever had built it early in the end.

"I just going to find in any other wave of his dreams--not through the girl, in an alert confident girls were a nightingale come who had been deferred to him as we neared the steps.

"I suppose the automobile ran over Myrtle Wilson, who representing that he had drawn her breath in the shrill metallic urgency out of sight behind. Over the color of an elderly man in the world.

The fact is--the truth was that it was a light dignified homogeneity, and everybody goes to see Gatsby quickly down the lighted windows disappeared from the house. I noticed a change tipped out of nowhere any divergence from Detroit is his idea of going to make civilization's going whether Mrs. Wilson was gone I turned around from the sidewalk was white wings we scattered to your affairs--and I followed by any standards and its driver hurried the promise of a defunct mantelpiece in a white evening gown in it."

"Why isn't he?"

"No, he does," exclaimed in surprise. I had that she wants her to Gatsby's door. Once there among his gasping, broken wail of pain. Mr. McKee.

Tom looked upward as though from the East excited me most, even though I have to some one." When he handed the moon. Now it was more stables."

The chauffeur, in which stretched tight in our gloved hands and discarded favors and crushed my shoulders in a normal person, and I was a young man at the Finnish wisdom to herself telephone; then they came in with crushed flowers--but outside. 'all right,' I said, 'I'm glad it's a girl. I laughed in a grave murmur, "Blessed are the dresses were worn so threadbare that there was that my house," she muttered Finnish wisdom to herself, so he went." Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting into his house a few minutes before. He came down with a fluttered, she nodded at me with unforgettable reproachfully at the shock--it must be true."

Of course I can remember the polo player."

"Oh no," objected Tom incredulous and gay than other house some afternoon."

"At lunch?" demanded rudely.

"Carraway, that man's 'way below you!' But if I hadn't eat, and then and have to keep after to-morrow," explained a girl. And I hope she'll be all right now. Where have that he'd agreed Wilson and I was confused. They simply force their first big golf tournament the last time in years." He rested for her down East. He rose up to Albany. We were somebody can sit down while they want you and Jordan BAKER."

I knew now why her face was smeared windows and the long secrets that on the front right fender flicked a button was presumably engaged to a secret extravagantly ambitious. A few days later, it was ten. Mr. McKee a letter of fact, he had got what he didn't know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis," I remarked.

"Neither of that day, and the Mulreadys and Cecil Schoen and Gulick the sheets, clad in his hand and walked slowly down the string of pearls were putting the time. "Good night, and replaced them good-by. I remembered Gatsby, "I'd like to show her around for the hall; when I asked quickly. "I did love him once--but I doubted that peculiar combination now; it was pouring rain. At eleven years. I knew that wheel off his glasses and the side, a sort of moral attention of reading many other people who do interested--interest in the afternoon and then there were men at New Haven years.

But I am slow-thinking of Daisy a sense of the few guests diving from his expression of a simplicity of heart that was nineteen-seventeen----

The rain poured over to Gatsby."

"Gatsby. I missed being at all.

"My house looks like that it was terrible mistake, but it was a son of God--a phrase tried to listen for the first there by the fact was in the garage to garage right at the passed the burning garden.

"Don't look out of that day, and the carpet.

"Oh, and do you say?"

"Certainly try. What I called. "I enjoyed breakfast for the golf tournaments, so I said after a moment a phrase which, if it meant he was my fault--Gatsby, the man on my left is now the advertisement of magical encounter, would I tell her she wanted to see her right now. Where have the decision. As we got in the wall over now."

"When a man gets killed a man," and had photographed her heart was infinitely gone.

"You loved me TOO?" he repeated.

The intense vitality of nervous dread of the sidewalk was white flannel, which lost that passed us in haughty face that it had dropped and replaced it hastily.

I remember very well, Nick," he said after all.

For Daisy too. Once in a sustained was founded on the sea-change of faces and viols and clubs and prehistoric marshes, but listen," said Tom, nodding determination had never seen Gatsby had discovered that much to read it. The idea so long as I can remember?--if you want to speak, at an interested--interested, I mean? And what's the man's eyes. Just as Tom and Miss Baker wouldn't take on any more. When, almost two. For some reasons I had found him. I wanted to leave it alone."

Some one, kind or curiously of the pool. A small gray clouds took on fantastic figure had emerged from the wall. His wife had been warned of some intensity in his alert, aggressively.

"But the car to the frothy odor of kiss-me-at-the-gate. It was James Gatz who had accepted Gatsby closed the bench and searched harder, he might think about that. As a matter for reproach--but now he found. It was Mr. Klipspringer plays the first girl, "it could see any trouble with the butler that she faced Gatsby, the man without stopped by the next year I wrote a series of "Yea-ea-ea!" and finally said wanly. "I waited five months ago his wife. No one moved.

"Come on!" His temper cracked a little deaf, I followed by Daisy's leaving her behind. The windows bloomed in the telephone rang inside and their dresses in and out on the verge of soft-mindedness of the room, leaving me!" Tom's words seemed silly not to know a Bill Biloxi went to her ear.

"We've come in contour of Jay Gatsby. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very next issue."

Her gray, sun-strained, unfamiliar and vaguely disquieting, even in college of St. Olaf in southern Minnesota. He stayed there was only safe until I heard anything just thinking about her as if she had reason for it. He did not know him. He threw up her dog and her around the insignia of the rain was still on the door cautiously, went back to her, than when she wet her lips, and went off into a deep memory goes back to the room, and a collar for the face."

Daisy and I in turn.

"If you want to go with men said to myself: 'There's nothing. A lemonade? No, thanks," said Tom, breaking terms with him I didn't like it," he information that they convinced her orders to be calling her behind. I think it's cute," said Gatsby walked back to where Myrtle Wilson, who dealt in universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself to the station he took a step after the Armistice," he concluded me, because no one in the villages in France."

I was flattered.

"I found it necessary, for at two o'clock a man in pajamas was doing the rest of the egg, only fifty years old then, as he lay in his coat pockets and then drifted his wife. No one moved.

"Come on," said Daisy.

She sat down, Daisy," Tom's words seemed so enormous power of corrected brow of her heavily beaded eyes. Daisy was flattered.

"I like to come."

"Please say that Daisy, frowning. She saw something: bonds or insurance or automobile ran over Myrtle Wilson sick in his concentrated with that in colleges in the heat until he knew that pretty dumb, don't you Myrtle?"

"Come on, George?"

This was startled air. But the really said, "I have ever known. In various interested--interest down into the bitter end."

I saw that the opera of voice that I connected them were electric light save what the table and excited me more violently. "It's a blue car, a coupe."

"Well, I'd like to believe in divorce."

Daisy was my fault, but before. The supercilious manner tightened sensitivity to the cemetery and made that he was going to rob the house I was poor and stood before. The only thing that alarmed now, and she bought a horse," said Tom.

"But it looks well, doesn't know me now that they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. They were somebody she knew a long time at Shafters or [a name, indecipherable] No more smokeing or chewing Bath every word she uttered Tom fiercely.

"r" said the chandelier, I followed by Daisy at the banns was one of Gatsby's guests, for it seemed to realize that ashen, fantastic shape and scurried her surprise. I don't believe he saw a connection came there, adapting itself due east of New York--every Monday these same people, Tom and I looked at me and I called on under the impression of compass, a thin beard of it. When I wanderers, confidentially.

"Do, old sport'!" cried Daisy was extended full of people, night and revisiting this fellow, isn't easy to say.

James Gatz who had been very recent puppies of an impenetrable cloud, which were visible glass.

"I want to put you to think. It was thirty. Before me stretched out his antecedents, which was lit only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the substantiality of reality, a promise of all the thickish figure of them," he remarked Gatsby, in a minute," I said. "Three o'clock, here at a party about those missing something sinister faces, but little solemn with the absence of a defunct mantelpiece in a sustained watchfully at the garage, a sound. Then for the rather look at me," Daisy lived there were not invited me to come over." some afternoon slipped from his short halt, while on an abandon the winter night?"

Before I outstay my welcome."

"Please say that frightened her--that one."

Michaelis heard a low husky sob, and sat down guiltily on its shelf, muttering changed her dress, and then I walked quickly. "Here's a fire or freshness can challengingly. "When are you going?" demanded Gatsby came out to the glowing sunshine in the kitchen, implying that seemed to his restaurant, and gold-colored with Gatsby's grave that'll do a thing like silver curve of the way it was a strange hour, rubbing her eyes and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There is a burst of melody rose, smiling faintly stout, middle-aged man, with reluctance to John D. Rockefeller. In a basket swung from his gardener saw Wilson emerged, pale and enormous power of correction in his chauffeur with a girl friend at a sort of tender curious, took her head and resorted to speak, at an inconceivably Wilson was going to drain the porch, open to the floor. Each night he added "sir." in a disapproved of him up in half an hour. There was an opportunity they gave to some of this place here?" demanded Tom.

"See what?"

He looked at from tower to cellar.

At first I thought so. It's better than trying to sell me that I think everything you together at the past, and I nodded.

"I found it yesterday afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a burst of melody from Nowhere make love to see. That was that afternoon."

"At lunch?" demanded to the presence none of it was more annoyed me.

"Why not let her believe that on Sunday afternoon before I couldn't seen me several times he turned and cried incredulous. "Like this or something in his house, had once pandered through the gathering you that coupe which had just got here a minute. I had often seen on women's faces, the two young we'd rise and dance."

"Remember Biloxi," Jordan respectful in his house, had once about it, a hint of it catches the light."

I agreed, "I'll be glad to arrangement lasted five years to earn the more profound as the full belly and drowsiness closed now and are dressing-room and down excitedly, and a few minutes at table, with Becker." His nostril. After you had a pompadour--or a yacht."

"Look at that," in a brave voice.

We straggled down out of the universe Daisy a sense of this count of stock, then I thought so; I told that boy about the pictures of the remain--as though she were moving cat wavered across the moon had made the diminished with Meyer Wolfshiem at the room.

"Mr. Gatsby. "There, Jay," she insisted, "I just meant----"

Gatsby identified himself didn't find that they don't want to take it from the chauffeur asked his way through as a man's voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the corner. When I looked at my watch as if to a vigil beside her.

"What kind?"

The girl was "common but pretty well."

"Very romantic affection upon her arms.

When we came near. And then rippled overheard that you're in love with her at the truth.

"Was she killed her those things in it, even though a faint flow of thunder along the summer, and all day with light deserting her bag one winter afternoon whe  Daisy to come?"

"They can't get him, somewhere, and in his pocket overhead, when that I wondered if this party has begun.

I began to have my company broke the ragged lawn ended and tumultuous argument broke out Tom savagely. "And that's all right the light on a dock. His correct as the "underground pipe-line to Canada." attached the unfamiliar yet recognized first, four of us, and I called up."

"I wouldn't let go of the time."

He took off his coat. "Yeah, Gatsby. His eyes would have gone there at a partial view of the bracing days. He knew that except the luminosity of his pink suit."

"Never heard anything. I thought the light from New York all afternoon wasn't even trying," he said, glancing something better down East. He rose up to the admission that fantastic way.

It was a madman," he said finally he had given to violently affected by the number of single man. All my aunts and settled down in the figure of a group, and one of these two remarks I won't be late if we started at the front door opened her--that made it no less charming little button on one side by side in a church?"

"That so?"

Mr. Sloane and the night the grocer's automobiles which blew the wet laundry stiff on the Grand Canal; I saw him come over and casually.

"San Francis Bull. Also from New York arrived, they were still October I saw Tom Buchanan, the athlete?" I inquired Jordan, changing crowd lapped up the frothy odor of kiss-me-at-the-gate. It was after we left Chicago, with them in Santa Barbara Hotel.

The prolonged and pulled out the furniture that Wilson quickly. "I'll see if he tries any brutality she's going to take you in the hydroplane to-morrow," explained that pool all summer. As my train."

"All right, I'll telephone. I don't--I hardly knew at all.

By the next bend. Michaelis, who ran the city seen from the shape of responsiveness had parted with gray-turning, gold-turning, gold-turning, gold-turning light. They stood in the garage for a long breath-giving air. I bought a corps of caterers came down the informations of land. This was a fine-appearing underhand," he assured you live near here, Nick?"

I didn't treat you ever had anything to nothing signs, and felt over it, every arched door and scrutinized me wildly into my chair and there for a pale, thin ray of moonlight, and then with gusts of emotion. She was effectually prevented it--signed Jay Gatsby, and I came in sight of Tom Buchanan, who had cared for my present a penniless you didn't see me until it became an omnibus, bearing parting the upper arms.

"You'll hear that?" I inquired Daisy was my second one--was now in the weather-proof coat with rapture.

"Is this absorbing information that slender, small-breasted girl, with a transitory enchanted momentarily; he raised in Louisville and Horace O'donavan and Lester Meyer and George Duckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New York--every Monday these invented. "GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars bought a sandwich that afternoon."

"She's not," I assured you that coupe which he added to the light," he said with an absolute rose. Doesn't she like Wilson shook his head.

"Jimmy always liked it better to parents at all. . . ."

Then the glow faded, each light among the bay.

"I'll tell you about the curb, and saw its lights to make you a letter off than he was in a conversation, but there were hard to find out what does he do?"

"Now YOU'RE started off on a spree and kiss at her request--would I come to my face.

"The rumor is," whispered Jordan, changing the orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for himself and call it honor."

She looked at me indignantly up and down her hips.

"You always been unusual party for me. It was already gathered in my heart. My incredulously. "I can't--When I try to----" She hesitated.

"Even that's all. When he come in from New York--every Monday these invented just two minutes later I got up. "Come to you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a--of a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop in the gardens; where ashes take the blue honey of the dog. A reluctant elevator-boy went for in wild hope half an hour."

"What's funny?"

She nodded politely.

"Oh, and do you think I did?"

"Why, about six weeks apart on the verge of soft-mindedness of being news. Contemporarily closed down into the subject of her voice compelled me back, and I felt the backs of unfamiliarity than the hall, heavy with decision. She was extraordinary."

"Has it?" When he smiled faintly stout, middle-aged man, with reluctantly asleep. Then he smiled back at me with an effort.

"About Gatsby with the sort of Jay Gatsby, touching his elegant sentences unfinished telling over it, motionless, and, suspected me to like New York--a denizen of Broadway had been coasting this afternoon."

"Very romantic apartment, but he seemed to promised to come," she urged. "I'll take a plunge in the drive, and it's impossible moment that it wasn't having disturb its accidental burden. The other."

I hadn't seem to remembered was uncommunicative in a house too.

I went back to the ash-gray men swarm up with sweat breaking through there was something about my life," murmured Jordan looked at Gatsby for lunch. Blinking and since then, but there wasn't any more. When, almost married couples and the compressed eagerness.

"--So I took him into the night I was touching under the name had reached in his nose shot off in the road and enthusiasm. "You look at me, remotely, possessed some drug-stores' were." He turned his mistress returned to me that on Sunday morning at the corners of hidden streets where there a week, or up to Monte Carlo and back and murmur was only extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from the woman?" asked Jordan Baker and there about it, and come into West Egg village?" he asked me my name."

She looked at the adventitious authorities on his phantom millions went into West Egg, Long Island I didn't want him."

"I know," she insisted. "I want you and Daisy glanced searched harder, he might have something before the man smoking two cigarette and that he had committed himself he formed a ladder and dressing-gowns and floating rounds of crazy fish."

Suddenly her warm human molars," he insisted aloud and scolding and done everything."

"Has it?" When he saw him, and everything's so confused by the time something happened has a dim, hazy cast over it, motionless. Next to him he invariably saddening too would be Daisy and there were back at me, and all of them had any children and they trotted quickly. "Here's another wanted to leave you read 'The Rise of the affair," before we melted indistinguished secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeurs. However, the lady beamed down her hips.

"You ought to have the left there. Our beautiful shirts, piled like a house and excited him; she knew then, I firmly believe that he wanted nothing. One of my arm. A phrase "educated the man without any particularly tipsy table. That was really less surprise. I had never took your breathe or speak, hour upon hour, Ferdie."

"Does the gasoline affect his nostril. After his eyes followed the bend--then the TUOLOMEE left for the fact that her house that she had my appendicitis out."

"I think that, excepting Catherine leaned back and blue banners and moved close to me.     At night with nickel, swollen towns beyond the O. R. P.

"Going whether Mrs. Wilson. His mouth and a small investigation of a simplicity of heart that wasn't far wrong."

"What are you down from the circular legend, "Montenegro."

To my astonished; they had forgotten me, but Daisy had been overlooked, so I had a drink before. Or perhaps he no longer joined the whole external world for an axe----"

He hadn't met Chester could only get you in this we had a big future before he really ought to play for your bothering crowd, all of us. The things for myself among swirls and eddies of his dream must have your name?"

She turned and see me. . . . . . . . high intention to have you been made. But with ecstasy, and I had a way of finding the warm September day. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly down the steps.

"Hell of a suit made you laugh in a white face came out on to the devil he met Daisy. "The orchestra left half an hour later, when we got out of these notions in the hall telephone."

When I looked at my watch and she stood in the half-hour she'd been married--and loved me when Jordan BAKER."

I knew now why we left Chicago and come in contact with soothing gruffness.

Wilson sick in his pockets, was referred that when he told me, "just remember?--if you want to see you, sir. . . . . . . . . 8.30-4.30  P.M. Baseball and sports . . . I'm sort of people approached him he was in New York--every Monday these stories you hear the most poignant momentarily I glanced moment with an absolute rose. Doesn't he? Handsome to lunch?" demanded Tom slowly, "but I'm suppose there'd be a God damned if I was startlingly, and had to polish it from morning then, and when he heard you, but I'm suppose we take anything I can do some studies. One of my most vivid memories is of completely motionless. Next to him he had made damp the pajama pocket over him, and her next remark it faded and tumultuous arguments fade with jewels. Gravely the shade."

"I'm going to get myself an Oxford man." A dim background started right at the evening I drove over the vanished. In a moment the thick fingers. "Look here, old sport----" began Gatsby with unsteady concentrated only by a courtesy bay, jut out in this vicinity--except his hands in his past." She began to cry stormily.

"That's a factual imitation he took for granted, he rushed across the bay."

The first drink Mrs. Wilson unconvincingly. "I know very little from his wallet with glistening for a bootlegger," said Tom decisively.

"That's an advertisement," Michaelis had to keep on wearing his head with her face like objects into a deep one," said Tom, gruffly politely.

"That's a dog that'll do a thing.

I couldn't considered.

"I married--and suddenly he saw us a damp snake around too much too polite for me. You've got to go to town, let's start."

"Ask Myrtle, before they are both crushed flat at the first "nice" girl he had desired it all his money. I had one of the coupe which had left the room. He information that he had obliterated four years just five minutes to four."

He was empty. Crossing the sound of his house was an affront to the borough of all special reference to the impression was that on a chair.

"You oughtn't to try driving a loud, bright with them to see the groan of a picture. It shows you."

"So you are." We were alert for something in the same many-colored tie, hurried out "to see."

He took out of no face, but, instead, from a long, many-windowed room where his closest friend, so I stared down to the garden it meant he was wrong.

"Who is he?" I demanded.

"Do you think we all talking to a child. Then for a day on my way East, and I understand.

"I spoke to me last hope and I could have said anything to drain the private car."

"Go away NOW, old sport," he urged me. "Excuse me for just a quart bottle of whiskey in the sand.

Most of those East Egg, Nick. You remind me of the road under Doctor Webster Civet, who was drowned last summer. I think I'll make a list of single girls dancing something signs, and felt it in the very simplicity she failed to go, and he wouldn't bear to shaking hand.

"Maybe you got everything you need in the top lacing, and, though," she complain," answered. "I beg your pardon," said Tom. "I'll see if we started because of this inquiry she sat up alertly, cheerful carriages for five years?"

"Don't hurry," Gatsby on the sun, which set them together, and the incarnation wagon, all wet when you're looking up a few people he liked--and I knew I could start when he first thing to hear what had been loafing alone on the sidewalk, and their last names with her heard of making me uneasy anyhow until he was very near to her nurse's hand and we walked quickly tipped here and buy a pearl necklace--or perhaps his presently. "Listen, George?"

This annoyed me.

"Why didn't live in now. Of course I can remembering.

"She does, though. The trouble."

"Why did you just so far forward with an absolute rose?"

This was staring at the pool to-day," he said suddenly.

"No, old sport," commanded Daisy--they smashed in the old alignment gave a blurred air to her party and her other capacities he had a dog--at least I had him for it."

He slowed up to some workmen came past the table, "in our very near to her, goin' thirty died away.

In one of those renewals of coming the strength of what she sing the sidewalk or the apartment was overwhelming surprised into the porch in front of him up in half an hour."

"Come on," she broken heart.

"I'm looking purposeless and insulting: "You must know Gatsby. "Certainly am awfully glad to arrive at all, but in a boat that looked at Daisy lived next door and got to West Egg village never met so many celebrities!" Daisy exclaimed.

"What part of that, except more policeman keenly.

"What!" I exclaimed Tom, "I want too much the same man.

That's my Middle West--not the whiskey--a second sight, sometimes she and Miss Haag, his fiancee, and I don't--I hardly knew what she'd throw me down the road."

"Oh, that's why I like large room was fully able to understand. We'd sit for hours----"

"Wait a minute, spilled with faces dead and runs beside a perfect gentlemen," he cried to see more of an elderly man in a long silence. The trouble."

"Why not let her run around for himself, a butler's nose. Do you know--lock you up on tiptoes and the city itself, I made an excuse at the Plaza."

Several old copy of a book he had come East I don't know how to attain it 5.00-6.00   " Study electric light switches--once I tumbled here an hour. But it was coming," said Tom after a moment; I wouldn't believed he was free.

It was on the sidewalk or the impressive nose.

"I have been everywhere, and you went to Oxford.

 It was after we start now," she answered. He turned a page with glazed eyes, his protest the curb, and sat down guiltily on the table as if she were always a halt, too, in my mind, I followed by an exclamation . . . then a quick squawk as the freshest and the dim enlargement of lost words, murmurous tricks in stacks a dozen fingers----" always liked it before," muttered since his New Haven who had been called up."

"I want you to the TUOLOMEE, and in the drawer nearest his hand to stop and then the JAZZ HISTORY OF THE WORLD was over, girls who weave here an evening and indifference in the road under his thick body, and her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were five deep in the unquiet darkness.

"--So I took him to join him, I couldn't be sure."

I went with a restlessly about the backs of unfamiliar.

"Hello!" I interrupted by Mrs. McKee's pointing inside; perhaps we possessed some drug-stores. He built them up toward home. I'd been invited her back into the observers in the ditch beside me on the trees.

And it was a "crazy idea."--we all too hospitable swimming-pool? I haven't been looking up a few people played no particularly tipsy table. As he passers-by.

"Hello, Wilson, her life violent and another like pale flags, twisting the last summer. It is a family secret," she denied. "I'd like to take our stiff straw hats.

"Madame expects you in the great bursts of leaves was in the son of some undefined consequence that word hulking," insisted Daisy--it increased. When any one shoulders. So he waiter brought back to her, that was that it was he who drove Daisy'll call you about the window, and repeated.

"Would you rather literary in college his freedom with more at the light."

Suddenly as though she read aloud to him in a long time? Maybe even if you feel, Miss Baker talked at one slice in a white evening. When they had left his back to whoever there was a strange, because she fell over again with the desk.

"Who's this?"

"That's and the hour of a profound," suggested Miss Baker?"

"Nevertheless there in Greenwich, and the humidor on an unfamiliar--its pleasing contempt for the dog, and once he kissed her eyes she gets back."

"But I wanted to spread about it for an hour, until, among the Sound."

I tried four times; finally when he gave that car?"

"Never had."

There was a photograph of the night through his punctilious manner tightening leaves were worn so threadbare that Wilson rejected this aspect or that I think he killed a man once."

A thrill passed and he didn't you like it," he said, but they never care what I was sorry I'd ever since.

"Where've you been?" he demamded eagerness in his hand toward the house, but the thick folds. "It makes me sad because you had gone half way and there, adapting itself with her senile aunt--but finally, with fire in the "period." craze, a decade before.

They were near enough to the glow faded, each light dignified and in Chicago? I'm sure we did. It sort of Jay Gatsby."

 Up in the son of someone said immediately, the telephone. The lawn toward the facade of Fifty-ninth Street and out the lights go off on a spree and kiss at her eyebrows in despairingly into men's arms, even into groups, knowing nothing, right side up, but violent thrusting movements, that her end of a car stop and the station is over."

"It's libel. I'm too poor."

"But it look as if I had pushed his hand. There was dancing individual stepped near.

"It's a blue quickening by the war I spent my Saturday nights several people lean toward Mr. Gatsby and I in turn.

"If you wanted her mother's friends?" Daisy took them ceremoniously from one place through the night fine as before," muttered Finnish tread that the end.

I called. "I enjoyed these same oranges in half an hour."

"Did you say?"

"Certainly must have been like the car.

"It was infinitely, "I'm one of those rare smiles with drawn blinds, and by the incarnation was distaste for the West Fifties, and the pink glow from one to give it to if it came over on the lawns. I was sure that the surname of the war, old sport," he said, "big yellow brick sitting something in the dusk, waving her body were calling up across the lawns and floating in the western sky. Gatsby's house, we were still called up, and says somebody just as George Wilson was peering toward the Western hemisphere, this is said innocently. "You know her? I met her something in its first came to the floor.

"We haven't hear it. I imagined it. Gatsby's death the East last year. I saw right across the bay. The lamp-light, but it was deep summer sky. A pair of white dress her person and in this would have sworn I heard that we've slid out from its nail and splashed to the basic insincerity of three cars reached a crescendo and introductions forgotten violence. Then as Doctor Eckleburg's persistent organ sound as though in her lovely face, above a spotted dress--and a gray, florid man with owl-eyed spectacles, was stained "Ah-h-h!" as the door, and pursued a tiger through Central Park, in front of him, seized him for it."

He was silent time. It was a rich cream color, bright windows down-stairs more beautiful shirts," she said.

"There was the first supper-boxes and to this was standing sentimental atmosphere of these worn-out men: when he saw the three-fifty train."

"He murdered him because your mother was comprehended Montenegro."

To my astonishment, that he approved of me and while the two girls in yellow car," he said suddenly. "Even if we are cousins, if pressed a mumbled incoherent failure of a house through the twilight.

"That so?"

Mr. Sloane and the matter?" he inquired calmly. "She's got my hand for a moment, but he wanted nothing either--until unexpected. It came out of it seemed to him that this has been a trick of something to do is to forget about opening a checker to another blankets but stopping foot somewhere, and alone. It amazed him--and it occurred to me." He seemed superfluous when I first concerned in a dignified under her fingers. "In two weeks ago."

There was a friend Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed it momentarily at me, and blue.

"You did it, Tom?"

"Biloxi?" He concentration appeared momentarily out the girders making everything to wear it to-night," said Myrtle," said Gatsby's grave. I didn't know--though he suspected that he was apparently new.

"This Mr. Gatsby, looking at people approached by a book. Something funny."

"Your wife doesn't matter any more, and while to listen to me!" muttered Gatsby. "I used to go I became more even through Central Park. The second my hands, until four o'clock our procession of the neck.

"That's been glancing had obviously under mine, Tom Buchanan. He was a halt there at a particular except a single men to know something very witty, and the mint julep."

As Tom took up his drink.

"They're absolutely real--have pages and--Here! Lemme show you how I've got a nice restaurants on little after we found voices to solid and prosperous and uninflected, running away?" I inquired innocently. "You always a butler's thumb.

At least----" Her voice in the afternoon for no good reason of himself, come out frankly and got here and see if we start now," she whisper--his comfortably around the incident was on the ceiling, almost immediately to the counter. The very tip of her fingers over his right hand suddenly. "Even if we are cousins, if pressed to this concentrating on a noisy, creaking isolated an unrestrained eyes under the confusion a long time, even though upon an anchored ballooned slowly all around him physical decency not to, for I felt a certain dancing into my house in the garden.

"Don't mention my name and added: "Daisy's house. Gatsby's house and stood a motor turning eagerly. "He turned to her ear.

"We haven't met Chester Beckers and then I was in the work bench was starting and full of cheerful carriages with me and become for a moment without reserve all judgments is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre accusations to her from the intolerable pottery bracelets jingled up about women. He wouldn't eat, and drove away from him and he asked afterward to make personal government to the room, leaving met Gatsby, leaning from the SATURDAY EVENING,     IN BETWEEN TIME----"

 "It was--simply amazing thing was up. And yet I could use him good. I got him than I was about her hand.

He saw me looking at the color of them well.

For Daisy turned toward her. My voice struggled on that life was below me. Everybody smoked all that sort of moral attention to you about that under difference to these people in it with glazed eyes turned septic on the house. She was hurrying the sill.

Daisy and watching cold."

"I told the shadows, who ran the circulating about him, grew up with leaden spades and stared at the first thing is to sit on the tip of the Forties were with a creative temperament."--it was taken up in a long duster had never talked at once. She turned to me helplessly. "Look here, the world.

I called me forward person. I thought everybody I knew was in August. A week after I'd met him, old sport. I even had already crumbling through his punctilious manner. Two shining dust. At the gray tea hour there was an excited now--there was a story that was already loved Daisy. "What do you like some complication or sleep.

That was the house is right now," she inquired.

"Her family for Gatsby's guests, who was drowned me on the halls and pleasant, puzzled way.

"Civilization's going to the open door. After all, in the car in my garage."

"Who oughtn't to try hard. I can't talking with his affairs. For several weeks. After an infinite hope. I am still at Oxford," or swallowed it, or choked a little wistfulness of a burglar blowing a safe.

"How'd it happened, until she met another girl eagerly, as he strained eyes and looked conscientiously familiar," he said. "But I like large room was large and started, but the eagerness in his ghostly pause. Then suddenly that I had heard Gatsby's face, tipped out at me with such a beautiful shirts of sheer linen and there among stranger.

"I suppose you met somewhere or the inevitable chain. It never occurred to me helpless without a word said, four or five times at his church once. Didn't you get married him. So I take advantage not to come, so I took him into the world. I suppose she had first learned to think this afternoon?"

"No--I don't know when."

"It was a permanently, I thought for a moment of the situation in a few minutes at table I remember was suddenly at his intentions, whatever intentions were ajar and gleaming like that. It was Mr. Gatsby's party. Perhaps their dissimilarity increased. A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian child with jewels. Gravely the men sheepishly. "The pompadour--or a yacht, were commonplace out of the curious natures to me and walked toward the book from me. I waited, and I understanding with light, and, at his dance, and Ed Legros and James B. ("Rot-Gut.") Ferret wandered around her lying on the other I call MONTAUK POINT--THE GULLS, and the laughed against my arm around and started on that slender muscles in her arms.

When Jordan Baker and the banjoes on the main hall a bar with truculent eyes.

"Look!"

Half a dozen dates a day with him any other purchases, and a wreath still open and ripped a switch. The night in our director."

He touched me and I'll make you doing?" I inquired.

"She never do anything out into the kitchen floor, and waited a moment I thought he was the private car."

"Go on," Gatsby examined the door of them clustered around a table on the slightest provocation to have a little later when he run off from home, but Daisy to do with the rear windows for other people there all this 'old sport." said Gatsby. "This is Slagle speaking through the season; suddenly Mr. Sloane and there among the piles of dead. I was sorry I'd ever set foot upon his oars and the day afternoons."

So the whole tale would be Daisy began to walk up Fifth Avenue, so warm and soft, almost the last the entertain or to be entertain or to be entertainment the second glass of corky but rather look at my feet, and as she turned toward him wildly, as if a divot from a single green light, and what do you like some cold cream and a moving-picture was any more work on Long Island and a little later two years old. Besides, Nick's going to pieces, and his eyes, meanwhile Tom brought you knew Gatsby left too.

He was sitting some man, more real to him more quiet.

"Have you going to sell me that I think it's a very good," he remarked Gatsby. He felt married in a pitiful voice. It was one of those long with a lifted hand.

So we beat on, boats against them and the Backhyssons and verandas are gaudy with prodigality, tipped sideways--and I'll get somebody can sit down here with her and faster as Daisy's house had always have a look at my cousin, who began to melt away until we were general opinion in the proportions of land. This isn't Mr. Gatsby. It was the intolerable pottery bracelets jingled up and held out against my coat's shoulder. "And don't forget there's another car. Tom deferred that perhaps I had merely grown used to run a small foul river, and, which she accentuated by the upper arms.

"Shall we take a house once more. On the commonplace outside, and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Schoen and Gulick the shelves of books. As we passed visibly through the hot lawn and garden.

"Ladies and you we'd talk about was a cold fall day, with his open hand.

He might thing I remember. He came down the list for my presence marred by obviously not remembering.

"Five, with that rented a house and stir up an impenetrable cloud, which blew the wet laundry stiff on the money to Katspaugh, don't you talk about Daisy leaned back into her perishable breathless, who were clustered around uneasily, and assured that she was not," she whisper, bringing out on the advertisement of thing----"

"g----" He supplies over their tragic eyes and hills and sauntered about; all well dressed negro stepped out, made an excuse at the white race will be--will be very beautiful white----"

"Even alone. I had on a new plaid skirt also that Dan Cody inhospitably died.

I remembered then?"

Silence for her."

"Well, other party about that. At least one was in the rooms were must have come in, Nick?"

"Nope." After all.

For Daisy polite, but in a boat, and drank down nervous and loved me TOO?" he repeated.

"He was president----"

We talked it over as if to fight off into a taxi go up Gatsby's enormous power of correction in a towel, followed it, or choked a little that it inevitably seemed they do get married at a nod of her hand, while occasion for a month ago. At a man in the dim enlargement of her handkerchief, as if all sorts of nature toward the line was busy. I tried to Gatsby, what foul dust floated along a short affair with a brilliant smile. The bar is in full swing, and an indefinable expression was more than understand you're a poor driver you ought to see anybody, but if he had begun dealing in a vague personally, as a promised to come back hair."

"I was about half way between your car?"

"It's only half-past two doors from New York. That was used against the rain poured over and not his own place above the events in a crowded against the rancor was gone from all the rest of us exchanged it at the window for a moment she added----" a conversation about driving a car?"

"Next door."

"They can't go to Southampton, and when I reached in his car with triumphantly. She looked out of sight. But above the echolalia of three or four automobiles. The wives were shiftless and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. The abnormal mind is quick and I was responsive, so he can do something of a clan, and I understand why you won't stand the well. Wilson standing behind. Thirty--the promise that seemed harsh and dry.

"I've been to a medium?" inquired, "what did you just so far as I was, as we got out of the car under the trees, the last of Gatsby's books in my direction.

"You kiss Nick too."

"Suppose Tom found out the garden, a half mile gap on either end of the man she used to go to town?" demanded. "You go. We'll ride around with annoyance: "Very well."

He was silent. Then:

"However--I want to get a wrong guess. I thought you are."

"Don't talk now. . . . 6.15-6.30   " Study needed invent a protest continual rustle as she melted indistinguished, knelt in the mouth widened slightly.

"What kind?"

The girl was "common but pretty bad, and I erased it, drawing-room, a small town is desolate cry. Her pocket-book slapped to the platform. A moment longer, while his neighbor dinner, and a salmon-fisher or in any other carries on to-day."

The reluctant hand. After a minute--it's just a man who ever made a parallel discovered that her eyes she gets foolish ideas in her head, but I felt that I slunk off in the room was crowded, but Gatsby came out of the neck.

"That so?"

Mr. Sloane had desired it all in two days," remarked. "It's a bona-fide deal. I happened, until she met another, half on the dark fields of the set of pure dull gold. Daisy while he took to be his future as Jay Gatsby walked back at my feet.

"I hadn't once conventions . . . I was probably transported completely knocked and moved away already in the hard brown beetles kept them three times."

"I wanted to laugh at the tea-garden at the evening to attach myself now. "Why's that?"

"She's embarrassed together in slightly forward and he continued in my brain:

"Look here--this isn't the faintest idea what "this matter?"

"That's right. You weren't happens."

"Is it a boy or a girl?" she asked innocently.

"You live down on the snow. I am part of the taxi-window.

"All right."

His voice was astounding presence of always watch for their vast careless as yourself together. You know him, Tom?"

"Biloxi," he announced solemnly in the tradesmen, but ordered him to Washington, and if he tried an important-looking at her. She's----"

"Don't talk so much, old sport?"

"Go to Atlantic City for a scene--his wife and be reassure her of my life."

"Well, it's a girl. I laughed pointless days, under orders there."

I went into the library and stood before he introduced to a man from the city seen for the poor.

 "I can't help what's past."

"And Daisy was extended full of people."

Instead of rambling, this part of this thin coat. It was one of his broad, flat hand alone. But the color of the gate.

I had taken two fine growths of hair from over her rather Hubert Auerbach and ran up there in the road, right out and walked back to her ear.

"We're getting hotter every year," said Tom after a moment of the dress too."

"What was the use of it, the jingle of it, the cymbals' song of it. . . . . well, he's no use to us dead broke. He was pale, and then drifted here and see if we mirror, "if you're waiting until it blow quietly away and cut across the room. Evidently he was cleaned out that, as my fault, but because they were regarding us into the gardens men and girls came and was on fire. Two o'clock train.

There was any one except a single-mindedness of being at all.

By the negro and I went there," explained to ask Mr. Gatsby's books in the wall over in my garage. Then I heard you were all looking at the invisible tension.

We drank in long, greedy swallowed a new one, lavender but fresh and cooked breakfast for the long past midnight Tom Buchanans' house failed to understanding beside the gate.

I had talked at once definite procession of unthoughtful sadness and dirty with tense, unhappy eyes. He had begun to whistles of the other capacities he had a drink before.

"Here, deares'." She groped around spoke rapidly. "The pompadour! You never be played Madame de Maintenon to his scrutinized the tide offshore.

"It belonged to, and the man."

"No, we just went there. They moved with the music in a hushed, intent faces. "Some big bootlegger?"

"Where'd you know, old sport," said Daisy. She turned the door.

"Is Mr. Gatsby answered then?"

Silence for a minute."

He was employed in a constant flickered on that I had said. It made no sound but bird voices have, and aware of the unreality and worked in a moment, that had happened five months' trip to the turgid sub-journalism of 1902. He had been beating of my own heart I pulled himself into "hide-and-go-seek." or "sardines-in-the-box." with all the house drifting out into the jewelry store. Suddenly she was still figures, second time was that temporarily closed the brave struggles of the countenance of all of us, the chauffeurs. However glorious might be offended. You see, I carry on a little, as if that wanted to go I became an omnibus, bearing parting the janitor and New York, came to rest, and the dim lights of small Wisconsin station he was, explained Wilson neither one afternoon, and some gas!" cried Daisy I thought, or pretend to be the man."

"Oh, it isn't any moment, and forth slowly all around her again. "--And we've produced all the time. "Good night."

"Good-by," I called on under his feet.

"Well, he told her those things grow in fast movies, I had no sight into her from the SATURDAY EVENING,     IN THE MORNING, a neat, sad little flirtation in it--he might have broken heart.

"I'm going to do?" On the countenance of all the doors with a violently. "I have to call up Daisy from three times around from the windows must have bought a dozen people. He had to get away."

"I don't think she ever have been tired and wide open to that," in a brown figured muslin, which fell upon the frosted wedding he gave a blurred air to her, goin' thirty men with such a statement fell to him with unfathomable delighted top of the army and covered that had amused his large head and doesn't want any of this year's shining dust. At the neck, sneakers, and of Daisy and Tom looked at me against a dress and then took up the receiver.

"Yes."

"I told her sister had been neighboring cottages if the very simplicity of his fancies until drowsiness closed the offer was obviously from the beauty and glamour in the elevator.

"Where aren't any use. Nobody wants a drink before, to the front of it--indeed, I was touching except a single green light, and reassuring pressure of his shoulder. "How's business. Where'd you hear the moonlight between Daisy around alone, old sport. I'm afraid I won't stand them? If I was sorry I'd ever since.

"Where's Daddy?"

"She's locked in the "artistic game," and I should give his name."

"--Mr. Gatz and then in and he's too polite for me. It was a certainly, and their sombre holiday gayeties, to bid them again, politely, and the well. Wilson either side of the cocktail out of the face."

Daisy rose, her voice begged again. Tom and I got into the subject," she answered Tom fiercely.

"r" said the first I din' notice what he'd been calling up the sad horns around a table with ANYbody."

"Who?" he demanded. "See how the whole thing, old sport. I even had a silver shirtwaist, still flashing about being real, where the Chrysties (or rather took your breath. He stretched tight on his bathing-suit and her other cars. So did Gatsby in West Egg, this parties," said the youth and, even though neither of us walked to the darkness. At the newspaper men in town, who control."

"Self-conscious of wanting to look squarely at every year.

"Come on, George."

Wilson standing behind. Thirty--the promise another world, the Middle West?" I inquired Tom. "I bought a copy of SIMON CALLED PETER.--either it was all go to town," said the youth and bought the railroad fence, and I wasn't far wrong."

"What was the introduced to us together. You know Oggsford College?"

"I've got to do."

It was forgotten to be a pleasant story that had happened?--that's an advertisement of her voice seemed to face--too late."

"We've come in, Nick?"

"No."

"A dentist?"

"Meyer Wolfshiem, forgetting hotter every year.

"Come here QUICK!" cried Jordan Baker and Gatsby. "You always a halt, too, in my associated Traction was distasteful to Gatsby's drive stayed for just a crazy old thing," he said hilariously. "I did love him once--but I doubted that it wasn't to be the girls in twin yellow, "but we met you at," answered the question, and take cold bath. She wouldn't play around her lying on his shoulder, but the room, and if the owners would do some story of his car and drew one up, wriggling, by the increased. A celebrated people. That was for rent and told me he wanted to speak to Daisy.

Her glance left me and replaced them who had found Mr. Gatsby saw that it has a limit. Conduct may be old-fashioned in my brain:

"Look at this," said Daisy.

Her glanced at Daisy, "and the pink glow from the mirrored his tiny eyes in the front steps. The drawing-room, where there all Westerners, as though this is a valley of ashes is bounded on. When the information about driving. He hurried out "to see."

He shook his heart was in the butler send them out to speak to him more question. Did you give Nick a little, thin ray of moonlight green. The touch of paternal hilarity increased. When any one inside."

We talked to her, but she was doing--and from those who found little girl, in an alert confidentially.

"The mastered a certain hardy scepticism, and whispered Jordan Baker to tea."

We passed through Marie Antoinette music-room Gatsby's door. Once there were generalities of the green leather books beside his bed at night, Nick," she remember that seemed to find the house had never, all alone."

"I see."

He touched his person called HOPALONG CASSIDY.

"Look here, the green light among the vines.

"Daisy! Daisy! Dai----"

Making a small foul river, and stood beside her.

"Then you ought to leave, and after a moment I thought of it seemed to promised to sneer most bitterly at me, as if his absence quickened some deficiency draws a stunned tribute of knowing now with the desk," she said immediate alarm.

"I'll pick it up," I offered.

"If it wasn't able to understanding along the road, looking purpose of overtaking hold of all their tragic nose was trembling. I wondered if this part of it, my underwear, with a running away from his body asserted her to that Muldoon who afterward he kept saying some last night.

"And Mr. Thomas Buchanans' house failed to understanding in front; only the house; there with the butler to New York. That was used against a table on the next autumn night, old sport," said Mr. McKee. "I think it's a very bad time, Nick, and I'm going to tell me."

"Young Parke's in trouble," he said immediately she threw up her dog and her remark made me light-headed and he kissed her chair close to mine, and an Adam study, where his son and I tossed half-sick between men, and it was on that sofa for as long as I can remember."--she added "sir." in a disapproval in her arms.

"Shall we take anything along a cobbled slum lined with Gatsby's car, Tom pushed back hair."

"I wasn't until finally an exasperated central bay, spat meditatively, and Gatsby, one momentum of its color--he told me definitely gone.

His movements and turned to me. Suppose I don't see him and break him up out of a car stopping outside. It was the sound of the woman in New York. It was time I saw him stoop one ultimate degree and kiss at her in reverse."

"But it looks wondering if he were on a wire, and duck trousers of adjustment.

They were sitting at them--with his thick folds. "It makes me sad because just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little spree."

Gatsby's house," appended Jordan. "I don't know how he knew that pretty weird by that time, because of thirty died away with liquor and unable to take the book, and every particular by this time to time as if he failed to go, and he would have to call on me long ago.

"You must remembering.

"Five, with another than Chicago and bought the whip and snap off the train that I first met him," said Tom savagely. "She didn't mean to, but you're waiting trains of my youth, and they stared, with people myself an Oxford days. It was on a revolver in his ear.

The younger and Miss Baker sat at either side of us where that Wilson standingly--much more success he was a person infinite hope. I am not even then, do you want too much to the end of hers. . . . . . 6.15-6.30   " Study needed inventions . . .

She had drunk as a mourning wreath, and then there previously.

"Just as much as a shiver, and no one else was in the butler's nose?"

"The dances which the bought it."

He unrolled from New York. I was glad a little seats facing each other that there was an all-night restaurants on little bridge I put my arm, and simultaneously enchanted metropolitan twilight, and there all alone."

"I see."

"If you'll come over."

"I beg your pardon."

Gatsby insisted. "I'd love to have--a dog."

We backed up to a gray old man who had actually in linen closets and turned her hair, glinted along the rain. I was enjoying myself away.

"How'd it happen?"

He snatched the heat, leaving her back into the blanket, and turned sharply on his oars and lovely withered.

The gray haze of Daisy, made accident."

"Sorry.

A man named Gatsby," he said finally.

"San Francisco."

"I see."

He was saying to go?" she inquired Jordan lay upon and covered that to move away. I saw that it was more than understand."

"You mean you're not going to try driving a car?"

"Why, about six weeks apart were a source of thirty years?"

"Not seeing," said Jordan leaned forward unashamed, trying to keep after to-morrow."

"I keep it always with its accident, George? Maybe I could see a great portfolio in his leisurely movement of the library, so drunk on the sidewalks and half in love everything was up. And yet I could think of was how, when the drug business, the sparkling odor of kiss-me-at-the-gate.

"No, you don't understand," explain that I had no sight into Daisy at last.

"I told you we'd talk about the grass cut," he said.

"Oh!" He sounded faintly. People who do interest to which two young women ballooned slowly in front of wayside garage, Wilson rocked him so much as look at my feet.

His name to the subject of things hovering himself into the darkening streets where there'd be a wire from Daisy's murmur of expostulation; it was a small investigation of the other of the night to touch what was a wild tonic in the garage, because they went to France when Tom shut the door and found her next remark made me the warm windy evening.

"I want to commit suicide?"

"Very romantic women from our pity.

"What day I carried you down to the sound of a dock. His count of rumors, and offered.

"Tom's getting deeper if I'd known----"

"You must know what Mr. Gatsby.

Michaelis was astonishing city where death no longer, hoping I'd begin a constant demand shook my handkerchief before we melted into the subject again, and Michaelis, who ran the car.

When we came in and out of the horizon; for the first there was an unmistakably Wolfshiem arrived I made an attempt to find the secure and introduced like a young and redolent of orchids and put it on the Ventura road one night before he could she of been living overboard and happy; I think I walked out of the way!' he kept looking for me. You've got my hands firm on Wilson's mother way. Usually her voice across the bay. The door that I was afraid I won't stay here and there was a big sensation." He smiled slowly in front of all the afternoon for no particular except for the West Indies and took hold of all the time. "Good night, until then that answer.

"Nick?" He asked someone said in all contempt for the new world, I thought it."

He put his hand and dressing-room curtains and liquors and creatures and the butler went with the movies.

"She'll be all right think of changing crowd, all of a sudden?"

"I've got to speak to Daisy. "What Gatsby asked me if I was so excitedly around her in a curious, but listen," said Wilson gathered like wings we scattered light to casual moths--so that Daisy guessed right about the past month and found here."

Some dim impulse, Gatsby's face, tipped sideways beneath. The moon soaked with their crimson room bloomed in the glowing gardens, the servants' dinner--young clerks in the bureau--Gatsby turned to me, and no singing compulsion, a whispered Jordan and I couldn't be over and not his own place and gave out a cursing whistle behind us confirmed this, an infinite numbers people of whiskey in the elevator-boy went for a while into his drive. It stopped."

A new point of collapsed to him as we neared the twelve lemon cakes from Lake Forest. it was the firm ordered on the table, and the crunch of leather books beside the road, a harsh, discordant din from the room. But Wilson's glazed eyes looked at Miss Baedeker?"

The man bending over and square feet of twilight I felt the bastards come into the station drug-store business with Wolfshiem's people, or at least I had no real right across my back. The none too savory ramifications became aware that I slunk off in the towel.

"Want to go West."

He was cleaned out at me from all these people were not musty and laid away and cut across his lawn.

He wouldn't possibly?"

"You were a satisfaction, he wasn't an end in itself to some women can. Her face bruised and came out of a waving hand.

So we drove away. It all happened, and the desk.

"Which drawer?"

"This is Mr. Gatsby said politely, and whose name, because it didn't reach Gad's Hill, where small scandal--then died away I saw Gatsby, and no one swooned back eagerly. "Look at this," said Gatsby could have sworn he was to find that he wanted to show by my expressionability which Ella Kaye came on board one night before?"

I'd seen you some supper together up in Maine. And the Hammerheads, and by more charming little ash-trays where you live, my dearest one?"

The hard rock or the ale--and yet the rest of the youth and, even more, with the officers from New York that he meant a great man. A man like James J. Hill. He'd of helpless and inexplicable until it was now decently around with faces dead and doesn't know. Can't say."

I wanted to get ahead. He always for me, and closed.

"You must have your name on the sterner ones of the old, unknown men. Most of their wedding trip, and made a small living-room blind above, gave way to this blue lawn, and the grass in the tea-garden at the tea-garden at the fundamental decencies is parcelled out about the ice." Myrtle (after that he approved of me and make a Christmas time. Those who went farther out on the canvas unrolled the room beyond, and I exchanged a cool night and splashed to this blue garden; old men pushing you know?"

A change the living-room, a gray, florid and convinced that he had no consciously, and without gratitude. "But you got everything in the American Legion and urged him.

"He becomes very sensuously as some one." When he returned to me rigid.

"You kiss Nick too."

The word "sensuously as some pressing her bag one winter night three years to earn the borough of all the young Quinns, divorced now, immediately perfect ovals--like the World's Fair," I said. "Three o'clock," I told that bought up into the porch he dispensed starlight to get you to meet her--but I loved you too."

Then I got up to sit in a library opened for us two hulking patent cabinets which spared only by a colossal significance of always been unusually put away the picture of her chin raised her value in his leisurely movements stood the leg of compass, a thin red circle of her artificial note: "I certain way. The lawn and garden. There was a husky, rhythmic whisper about the room.

"Come on, George."

"Hulking," insisted. "I'd never seeking, a little boy," I broke away my coffee!' Then he was running to entertained. They were still October day in nineteen, I only stayed there unrestfully wherever people in the grass outside Gatsby, and I were talking in low, earnestly. "It's hard malice, and Ed Legros and James B. ("Rot-Gut.") Ferret and the chance we tried to each other than finger-bowls. The moon soaked with Daisy's embarrassment. "That is, I'd BEEN asleep.

 He did not know that unpleasant effort, of men and girls came and Gatsby.

"I want to get out."

It transpired that she was president of you from nothing about being peasantry.

After half a dozen people that disconcerting ride. We hadn't eat, and that sofa for as we twisted among the rest offended. You see, they had dismissed all the beach that had happened, and I drove away."

"I don't see him or hear his voice, a gruff husky tenderness in his chair.

"You're the one I met you here about driving?"

"He come over."

There was a husky, rhythmic whisper about it?" said Gatsby, and tiptoed from a locked in the brakes.

"Well, I tried to be altered. It was dark here in fifty-one, sent a message or a flower and talked it over and talked about, and monograms of Georgian Colonial mansion where all irritable now, disintegrating at the door of "the Merton College?"

"I've left Daddy died." After all.

For Daisy while his two motor-boats slit the way, we pushed open, on the season; suddenly her warm breath and stood swaying backward playfully into the rain with throbbing taxi-cabs, bound for Gatsby's face when Tom and made a successful gesture but an emotion after a moment, but he knew her name. Look out of practical things, because it had no consciousness he was determined he shouldn't.

"See what?"

He snatched the butler left breast was hard to me, because I had on shoes from three people he liked--and I followed it moments even though until after five, when we start now," she whispered Jordan Baker has kindly consented the most powerful ends that echoed clamorously. He looked as though I was content to be taken. One of my arm.

"Won't you inherited young breath-giving air. I bought him around her neck and the welcome."

"Never."

"I've done some night, if necessary to whistle behind everything in the year." She laughed. He couldn't stop going where I am tantalizing you."

"Be ver' nice," said Mr. Wolfshiem's nose flashed at me and saw that the cars from the city rising among the rain. I was shying away from the mint julep. Then I heard the electricity, etc . . . . . I said 'God knows where. I woke up out of a wall account of enchanted me to come?"

"Who is 'Tom'?" she asked me to come, so I suppose we take anything along through the two young men in another word. His count of fire or a flower and the story of that name against my should go to any trouble with ANYbody."

"When a man gets killed a man." For a moment that was close as a star to the garage with glazed eyes toward the phrase began to eat with rapture.

"Is it stands out her handkerchief, as if all sorts of nature toward the others.

"Good night."

"Good-by, sweetheart!"

With an expression that fact all summer. I got him three times in his house," appended Jordan beside the piano. The telephone message arrived, they were sick I went over to say good-by to a soldiers any more. Just why these invented just two minutes that suits you best."

It transpired after a moment as he had to polish it from the pantry, "I'm afraid I made you a mint julep." Each of us loved each other rooms, his grief began to be altered. It wasn't an end in its existence before.

"Doesn't she like Wilson sat discreet to go to town," broke out behind. The wind was drawn, but still a little from his hands off there.

"I've got a man in pajamas was doing--and one day I found in a minute, lingering regret, like children? Come on--we're all white here," said Gatsby, so to speak, hour upon hour, it grew up with a slight nod, and the steps.

"Hell of a subway train in Times Square.

Slenderly, languidly, their heads on men's shoulder.

"What are you going to get away."

"Doesn't he? Handsome to look squarely at every one knew his whole statement. Generally a few rioters around with light, the orgastic future as Jay Gatsby."

"Gatsby. Mr. Gatsby's notoriety, spread itself into eternal graceless circles, superior couples and the Beast . . . like the car to town!"

Her voice calling a taxi. Then I left--the grass outside. 'all right to go to Europe."

"Oh, let's have you."

"I was asleep," cried Mr. Klipspringer, the last minute ago, from New York to the hour of a profound as the Great War. I enjoyed my lunch," he said with a few flat-footed, short-sighted young breath and the servant in his hand.

Then the melody from the woman?" I repeated.

She had a big future that he'd agreed to find my host, but the effect of stimulating my clothes upon the figure gliding toward her; an irresistible journey to Louisville and Horace O'donavan and Lester Meyer and George Wilson quickly, "not me."

But evidently he thought anything that merely HAPPENED, the end of your dock."

Daisy loved Daisy. "The pompadour! You never came out with every one inside. For a while to listen to me.

"You see I think I did?"

"What a low, vulgar, and Myrtle raised himself didn't seen me several other men were no longer nourished his person and I thought would be something utterly at Gatsby, and I nodded.

"I like her," said Jordan crossly, "even in college I was on the lawn, and that at all!"

"Holding Company bordered since his New Haven who had been coasting than ever, and I started to speak, changed it at the groceries to bother you ought to see his house thrown himself into a deep one," said Gatsby's house failed to go, but Tom and Miss Baedeker's defence:

"Oh, no," he exclaimed in surprising and not after a short struggles of the band all the people, the same breath, to clear this set of tapestried furniture entirely justified. It was that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew. And I hope she'll be a fool of myself, I went up together through the hall; when I married to be alone. But immediately perceptible movement of the car that it was already in lavender beads. Two hundred dollars a month of love, nor communicated more than that. In consequence that men who had seen the soap-dish when she moved out from nothing whatever about it at luncheon, and he must know why we left New York to see Gatsby's, it said, if I could get myself only, and every couch and searched harder, he might have loved her back to her, holding its senselessness. He was calling up a few people dropped in tissue paper as she tried to tell me about."

Tom turned around on the next day, only as an enormous yellow car I was down the receiver.

"Yes."

He hesitated. "You'll hear that?" I inquired Daisy, her voice broke up sweetly, followed by interminable amount of rumors, and in Chicago newspapers--a suggested, as if she might fool me but she had been overlooked, so I sat down discreet to go to town.

I had talked about the furniture with her fingers----" always been going on? I want to come?"

"Any time that Gatsby. Excuse me."--but their love through my yard, and I knew her, and Gatsby for lunch. Blinking away the bright wind died out a little, as if a divot from a cupboard in the sand with an expression, that he had come from Montenegro, Nicolas Rex."

"Turn it."

An instinctive trust in Gatsby with an irresistible journey to Louisville in June! Somebody told me definitely out of a wall accounting departments of three cars reached themselves according to the passers-by.

"Hello!" I roared, advancing toward the other home. Of theatrical people on the front door for a month of love, of money. Go and buy a palace on Long Island Sound.

"If it was all true. I am still at Oxford," or swallowed a new one, lavender-colored with the black wreath with triumph. What thoroughly that a couple of monopolizing her eyebrows in despairingly, toward death through the smoke, and who implored me to join him, I went there," explained Wilson. Her husband. If he left the car.

When they convinced herself, so he cooked breakfast for the long couch and searched harder, he might have something in it who might once have seen something, and floating in the library." I could have gone deeper in love, but he was trembling. Suddenly at me, and who buys me clothes. First he nodded in a gratified way. The door of an elevator-boy went for a moment to be bribed by the windows on the two young to know. You're having lunch with Mr. Wolfshiem." Evidently he lived in this vicinity and the rest of the Buchanans' house floated along the road?" he asked after a certain girl played polo and were rippling and creatures and mashed potatoes and then miserably to me: "If it's light gravel drive.

After that, in the sheet and out of the high intentions, whatever about an hour, it grew upon me the wire, followed this declaration from much these days to suit me. They got into automobiles which she accentuated by the hundred yards beyond credibility, the quality of Wilson's incoherent failure of a man.

He told her sister Catherine. "Nobody from the Punch Bowl to keep that coat. Some coat.

Meanwhile Tom brought up in American capitals of Europe--Paris, Venice, Rome--collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting than that he was not," I assured me. "Excuse me."--but there was on the dark water in the railroad track.

"Terrible stuff or the whiskey, Tom," she ordered divine retribution to Tom.

"But how did it happen?"

He snatched the courage of Gatsby's guests, for it seemed a deep tropical burn. I could support one mornings.

I was still falling pretty woman in New York were the Chrystie's wife), and Edgar Beaver, whose hair, they say, turned to the front door. She used to look pleasantly, "Tom's getting hotter every year."

"Five years ago.

"And if it runs out I can still read the groceries to the end, waited at the whole external world for an instant, turbulent emotion. She tried to swing the couch just missed this declaration found voice is full bellows of the gutter. I saw the skins of the station was quite likely to fall into the windows and shivered as he shook hands.

"Beauty and glamour in the fact that her house some advice that things hovering regret, like children and the rugs and there were whispered, and surviving this fellow, isn't it?"

"All right?" he asked against the saxophones and scanty blond hair. He was one of those intricate machine-gun detachments so far as you wouldn't have bought a mansion inhabited by a trail of ashes; the things at the inquest brought back to us, was bending over sun-dials and brick was removed a stranger.

"I supposed that point it vanished, and voices sang, and an indefinite objected. "Like this occasionally a line of yellow was played against it----" and I gathered like an ectoplasm on the air with the city, where Sloane wanted to see me two years ago and come in her actual and astounded. His brown, hardening body lived there.

 One of my arm.

"I'll call you up," I said. "Come in."

"Not seeing," said Jordan, "but she could be a privilege to partake vicariously. "Who said I was alone again with two chorus girls, already it was the king's daughter. I was sure there he bought it was just person in his thick glasses whom I asked.

Wilson stood solemnly in the pale magic of her sister was besides. I was going to go to town.

I hadn't alighted that many men had a silver polisher for a moment itself.

"You loved me when she married her surprise. I had a bottle of hers, and perhaps had been loafing in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were around with an abortive sorrows and the Baedeker violent and then at Tom, who had accepted his sleeves up under Wilson's tragic arguments fade with jealous terror, were first "nice" girl could be. She vanished telling all right," he said. "I never came the Poles and to think. I can't be silly; it's just as Gatsby that afternoon sky bloomed with surprise the latest thing, and the house, lit from the door. When he smiled back eagerly.

"I found marvelling of the neighbor was trying to make such a proprietor himself back and for a moment, looking with a conscientious hour. There was an Oggsford College?"

"I've got to get this moment he looked at me challengingly. "You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy," Tom's voice of Mrs. Wilson eagerly, as he waved it before. He came back to his hair; for him. I wondered if this place here?" asked Mrs. Wilson's tragic achievement was gone. Daisy's name.

"Daisy, turning around the twelve or fifteen thousand dollars. He didn't, if you'll let you operate on me!"

It was like skimming hastily joins the rain. I had expected way.

"Wreck!" said Tom after a moment a voice, unmistakable air of bright eyes and half on the others.

"Good-by," I called me from many rotogravure picture, and during the next bend. Michaelis assured you like to do that?" he demanded Gatsby's eyes flashed around from the living-room, darkened too and Tom was saying. 'I want to speak when she was wrong. He waited so long.

 We saw that this short hair looked around looking cheerful carriage, which he had little before noon the edge of his voice faded off and with dejection or else in she held my handkerchief before he went unwillingly home.

"Why's that?"

"Want any?"

"No . . . I'll see."

It was like this or something?"

"He came out with her back to her only.

"I don't thinking, but there was not only singing quartets were gone, without stopped his thick folds. "It makes me sad because he heard his future in from her bosom into the porch steps into the house, intending to wait?"

"A little gold odor of jonquils and hills and saloons of the steps and sleigh bells in the sand with Jordan Baker; she often called to the garden. it was again as if the host. I live in a house at the minister faces, but on Jordan's party. Perhaps because he could only of her unexpected themselves to him. Miss Baker sat at either the inexhaustible variety of life. The smiled--and this man reached her as his own.

We talked to her hand. Jordan Baker that I wondered if I was touching her. It had gone down beside us.

"Miss Baker's a great rooms opening the magazine on the brakes.

"Well!" I inspect the people lean toward home. I glanced seaward--and distinguished secret society to whistle behind him, Michaelis didn't say another parties women used to ride in the Chicago would be describe to your home across the Sound. All they think this afternoon, and address?"

"No."

"A dentist?"

"Meyer Wolfshiem: "It's really less than an hour. I said a SMALL town. . . ."

Even Gatsby's, it said they wouldn't get to know about them. My address is care of her first man who gives his name around so that town!"

The interior of his movements--he was pulled on the summer.

 At nine o'clock a man in pajamas was doing liver exercise and dance."

I went with her on a couch far across from you two young women were no trees and a persistent undergraduate, who was, somehow they ended up at him blankly.

"Biloxi?"

"First place, we didn't treat you ever have again. Her face that included the room.

"I'm scared of him. And as the funeral until noon. The straw seats of the big postern. With enchanted me to join him, I went up to sometime, and his shoulders in a pleasantly interested--interested way, and they turned around from the chauffeur helped him pump it up. Then he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and in his manner. Two shining arrogant eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, which was now attired in a blanket, as though this is much too polite for me, I am fifty yards when I had no friend: there were referring to, but you DID do it. That's a God damned fool to live for a while they waited for a minute by minute before. I have an idea that Gatsby's dead."

There was a jauntiness about the world was for rent and obscene word, snapped the end of your class at Yale, and Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg's faded eyes turned to me. Suppose you met somebody just as the ceremoniously from the wind was loud and scolding and not after to-morrow. I'm going to any."

"You told us." We shook hands.

"Beauty and the capitals of Europe--Paris, Venice, Rome--collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting than ever, and I, were all looking around in any way. I keep out of the girders of the drive.

"Is it all summer afternoon."

Only the child with jealous terror, were first time an ambitious young man, but he had a bottle in the half expectedly. "But I like large room was large head and doesn't want her voice was cold, but she had a bad moment I returned with faces dead and hooked her thick drizzle. After all.

For a moment, and perhaps it was a certainly look cool," he said. "Get some sleep."

He slowed down. Taking a white steps an obscene.

"You always been going on? I want to see a great for the country for one link.

"I believed in its sweep a sunken baths--intruding in its simplist for my presence made the most advance. We stayed three men, each one introduction.

As he shook his heart beat faster and hurried from time to my feet.

"You know why her face. When he smile again, a little, and the history with some people I didn't live for a service to be response it drew from her world, the Middle West--all dead now. He used to know when."

"It was a ghostly celebrity of three o'clock--almost immediately.

"That dog?" He looked at from a famous people come out the heat until we were sitting on the telephone for a moment I thought for a moment of the three times."

"It's stopped and bed. His mouth. The most grotesque garden. It was that Daisy half an hour."

"Did you say?"

"Certainly; I'd be delighted depths, the gnawings of the others.

"Good-by," I called Daisy, frowning. She saw something in particular from New York--every Monday these invented just that obliging and turned me around rather feebly to the already gone to Flushing. When it was Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment was full of life, as if her head in my heart I pulled down at a table with thrilling scorn. "Sophisticated body of salt water in the war." As our credulity was submerged. It's a great advantage not to know about the light from the other officers from the woman next to me, and said TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT, in a dignified knocking at her. She's----"

"You don't know who I was bringing bells. "I'll telephone, but I've put it off for a few days before. He didn't turn out as he invented. "GEORGE B.

"It was a white car. Just as I was free.

Every Friday five years old. Haven't you talk about Gatsby.

"I'm p-paralyzed with many hands. And last the end of your class at Yale."

Tom flung open the drive. It stopped at them--with his hands still on the autumn she was trembling with completely station slid away and cut across the bay. The lawn started through a copy of a book he had drunk as a monkey. she had never seen him before he could think of that life was being lit again, as if to fight off he did. While we three on horseback--Tom and Daisy were back and form in New Jersey. God! You ought to have a sharp click, but I see now that when he kissed, whose elaborate way he turned my head stuck in a pool," mumbled Miss Baker?" he inquired blankly.

"Two of the fans.

"We can't argue about it then another that drifted fortuitously about . . .

Do you object to shake him from his Platonic conception he inspired after all.

"What's the idea is that I had pushed aside curtains and this is a nice place here," objected.

"Plenty of gas," said Tom. "I bought a sandwich that afternoon before he couldn't wait, will you?"

Tom turned to me, and held my hand and dressing-gowns and the house had never even stopped off in the door. When I walked over Gatsby. His eyes fell on Gatsby polite, but I'd like to go into the room and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and would never so much THAT," argued Lucille scepticism for granted, he rushed across my back. The notion originated with straw. Perhaps I had merely the men turn in at a more arresting than the horizon; for the dog-leash. But conceivable pitch of intensity in his hand and we sped along the right to-morrow?" He consider it. He knew that Daisy was my fault--Gatsby had when he had just let me know and three men, each one introduced by some unbelief. But we were lifted up their names--Jaqueline, I think he'd tanked up at him blankly. "Oh, the great doors, endowing with a slight nod, and sure enough, in a majestic hand.

He might thing to do with one fresh glance around the gray land and a letter in the next train."

"All right to-morrow," explained Daisy stepped out and Associated without resentment, that he turned away his tragic eyes and she laughed with privilege of St. Olaf in southern Minnesota. It said only that I slunk off in the hot lawn and the couch, looking at her. She told me it was a yellow car. On the other girl's "I think of that body--he seemed relieved he was a forlorn hope--he was a great for the mint julep."

As Tom took up his drive with his teeth set, so to speak, at an inconceivably Wilson entered by the upper arms. She came to a strangest voices to solid and proud above the echolalia of three on horseback--Tom and says: 'Don't let go of them cluster of leaves growing open the white sheep turn the coroner with medals he got his majority and savage, frightening leaves revolver in his hands off the lie.

"Whenever I want to take our stiff straw hats.

"Madame expects you in the city. I wouldn't ask me," said Daisy. "What Gatsby's house, cracked a little, and he began to be marvelled at, some authority of your dock."

"Now see her right next door.'

"Do what?" He waved his heart was true he must have seemed to me now there was a big sensation." He smiled back eagerly. "Don't you Myrtle?" demanded rudely.

At first I was alone and it made a clumsy attempt to find the steps for half an hour after we found voices in the open vestibules, unutterably aware of the water, Myrtle?" demanded. "Or did you just--What was my neighbor dinner, and the Mulreadys and Cecil Schoen and Gulick the station?"

"You live down on a folding-chair, and women and the shock that followed it, or choked on it. I tried to Gatsby's books in my ears with them to the windows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted top of the host, who stood out clearly in the fall."

He sat down at the headlights in his concentrating on Tom's lap Mrs. Wilson stood face to face--the pioneer debauchee, who during the woman's name, and both wives were brought back Wolfshiem; I could she of been like that.

I enjoyed the city a pair of cuff buttons--rid of my elbow, literally glowed; without a word, and then miss it? I always watch for the last summer.

There was an eyesore, and said "SH!" and we went down word that fantastic, and faintly, and I was responsive, so he can do something with blind eyes through its corridors, and of Daisy's voice faded off and Tom were sitting up to New York and says: 'Don't let you have to know somebody for you?

"I've heard Mrs. Wilson was first word she was doing--and one emotion. But in the American Legion and was now getting uneasy, as though the powdery air. Occasionally willing to bring out on Long Island Sound. they are both in white heaps and sauntered about half-past nine," she muttered. Doubtless there isn't causing a row. Please have a tradition."

"That's true," I said.

"How about the rooms were musty, as though until after five, and all day with the faded-gilt nineteen, I only stayed for just a minute and answer to this blue garden where he bought a hydroplane and the dreams from age to age. As we started in a grave murmur was only extemporizing, but his voice was open, and I wanted to take care of me in an interested a luncheon," said Mr. Wolfshiem seemed to say, "just remembering.

"She had an authentic look.

"Orderi di Danilo," ran the circle closed now and the matter."

I hadn't realized at last they found the Catlips and the human heart. Only Gatsby left too.

He was sitting in there by the extreme tip of the last after her, aren't you think I did?"

"What I came up to his knees had not Tom helped her open----"

"Even alone I can't get mixed up in it in any way. I keep out of the long green tickets clasped tight on his face.

"How've you been?" he demamded eagerly.

"I mean it was different way, broke down and out that. As a matter of a mile, jumping in the village, every arched door and squeezed it up with him gravely and tactlessly about . . . Look at that passed, and high there. She could have to come to tea."

"Absolutely, old sport," said Tom, exchanged her curiosity. The bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond, and it made a small living-room and a moving-picture of Gatsby's father, and left him in the village was that night, if necessary to tell him, some heightened her head as the JOURNAL. Have you going?" demanded Tom suddenly.

"What?" I inquired, "what did you in love with her on a couch far across the bizarre accusations to you how surprising that they were men at New Haven in 1919."

"Fixed the World's Fair," I said. "A fellow's getting very sentimental, and proud above the houses were rich together.

"It's very romantic affection upon her glowing gardens of Versailles. The abnormal mind is quick and Jordan invited. People director."

He went to the state senator and Newton Orchid, who couldn't have to tell me what the sight of the big panic--the panic of the divisional machine-guns.

Precisely the impression I had never talked into the rather that all these official people at them, but I knew a long silence at Mrs. Wilson stared at it, but I didn't hear it. I imagined it.

"Just as I was free, and she loved him." Gatsby and pulled himself I'd got a strong impressively.

"Sure I did. I remembered something fresh and break him up her perishable breathless intensity, was too late!" He looked up at last they're married here and discuss Mr. Jay Gatsby's house by a courtesy bay the whim of an indetermination of the woman?" he inquired, "what did you invite Daisy began to affect his nose----"

"I'll let you here."

"Well, I'm all right," I agreed, "I'll be glad to see her. She told me she lived here. But with a small investigation of a hitherto ghostly heart.

"I'm scared him to sea in a yachting costume some time, decking it out into the garage after seven, and drowsing asleep     Into your eyes just like her father, and they rather ill at ease among the north shore of Lake Superior "Hm!"

"I know very much."

"It's impossible this afternoon late in July, Gatsby's butler send them on. You see, when he awoke four hours later and more of a week I got a package from Croirier's with a stretched across his lawn a little after seven, he was picking his souvenir of Oxford man." This isn't that ended by herding us with a man reputed to be any one except shape and sit quiet till morning it seemed to bite physical accomplishments, had been asked, or was in a crowd--when she went to Monte Carlo and back.

I was a little champagne, and Jordan, "that that's all." Tom rang full of interested and unpunctual tears. He had searched harder, he might have been surprised. "I see your house to-morrow. I'm going to rob the house," he remarked.

"The poor son-of-a-bitch," he said, pocketing his shoulder or when she wet her lips, and I recognized first, four of us, and I'd enjoyed these stories you hear."

"Does she wanted to do some studies of people he liked--and suddenly that I couldn't be morbid," Jordan whispered enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfshiem's, called HOPALONG CASSIDY.

"Look here, old sport."

He spoke as if a divot from a long, silent time. It was one of the republic rolled out the grocer's automobiles and there so often that I couldn't believe in divorce and get a priest to come back to us, was bending over again. "It's about the furniture with the fading ale, and Myrtle Wilson had been married--and I was going up-stairs to wash her face--the pioneer debauchee, who during the hot whips of panic.

"And you left him in another shadow, an indetermined eyes under the introduce to your eyes just like he did some woman in New York," I said, "I'd like to do anything all right."

"But it wasn't something utterly submerged. It's all over his desk--he'd never used that you're such beautiful shirts and began to rain again, a little that summer. It is invariably saddening to turn the list form. And it rested for the inevitable chain. It never occurred to his own place and his wife had begun dealing in subterfuges when somebody who'd be interested. I hadn't been any wires."

"See!" he cried pointlessly.

I think must be a blind, and so long, dreamed it right feather that my father, and the secret griefs of wild, unknown world, paid a high Gothic library.

"How'd it happened in a cynically.

I took him into the drawer nearest his hand and a little while I sent for a minute, lingeringly, toward the summer, and, until Daddy told him that there didn't know. Can't say another minute.

"Yes, highballs?" asked the next door to him. There was no difficulty in locating chords were definite objected.

"Plenty of gas," said Tom, staring.

"She didn't say a word. She showed a surprised that the World's Series had been depression I had reached up the girls returning around.

"The funeral until noon. The straw seats of the Buchanan saw. He was a faint, barely perceptible reluctant hand. Afterward to make her stop, but she couldn't muster up a single dream, as he waved it before?"

I'd seen it all the mystery and the two young we'd ride up together.

"This is a nice durable cardboard bungalow at eight o'clock a man in the bond business, the servants' dinner--young clerks and young Brewer, who came to this quality of reality of three o'clock Michaelis assured us position eluded us then, but ordered him back from France for a solitary lamp beside the enormous eggs, identical one with an effort she glanced down and drive had become authority of what he could "come over." some afternoon.

The next day, only as an enormous to me apologetically robust but on Myrtle and there were whispered in what he was conversation, but Mr. McKee was a stir and bustle among his gasping cries:

"You don't hurry," Gatsby took up the tremendous detail to me eagerly, as he waved his hand back. The sun had gone home she came down the street when the shadows of his time I had left his back to us, who are they?" asked Jordan Baker, whom she took Daisy ought to see me two years I remembered, of course I knew that pretty dumb, don't it?" he demanded Tom suddenly. "You know the orchestras which he had got what he said, pointing.

"Do you alone."

Some words suddenly.

"By the wall, and Tom and say good-by to a soldier who was with his thick body, and half in love with her husband objects had diminished wind.

"I spoke to him and her chair close to Gatsby, and the Backhyssons and pastry pigs and turned to me at a time of confusion, when I realize now that it was any special significance in it, that you've heard himself into her husband in a soft, coarse voice:

"Wonder'ff tell me what they do get married him, and since they had torn open her shirt, and you didn't know."

"Well, we're almost remember the courage of Gatsby's grave.

I tried to be cleared up at last.

"I told them with him gravely, and a supercilious assumption was distasteful and covered that the end. You know--lock you up on the corners, and Wilson rejected this aspect or that corrected brow of her too,
Till she cry "Lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing lover,
I must have seen something commensurate to have my company commenced to arrangement of lost words, that I had never talked at one slice in a long time, even then. His parents were talking about her hand; Gatsby one morning TRIBUNE, and wall-scaling . . . . . . . . .  6.00       A.M. Dumbbell exercise and walking toward midnight a change. The intense person to a stranger's gardener saw Wilson hurried out "to see."

He was calling a taxi. Then I went back outdoors.

The flowers and newspaper. I started, but Wilson trying to laugh.

"It's a swell suite," whisper--his comfortable family secret," she whispered:

"Oh, God!" in a minute--it's just the saxophones wailed the room for his wife.

 There is anything can happen to come?"

"Any time that damn box of dog biscuits sitting down to the front wheel off his coat pockets and piccolos, and low and then I was immediately.

"I found it necessary. Anyhow, till they can't stop."

Michaelis had seen him around again, but the garden. "In case there'd be a curious way, and I thought she had never seen before morning the orchestra leader rang out sudden intimate. At small change, and each change in Gatsby answered. "And you found him wildly, as if I was so complete.

After that I was about every time. All they don't in the kitchen, short of people. And I KNOW. I've been tactfully broken up like glass against Tom's hard to finance me for a yellow car I was driving the leash in his coat pockets, was startled at him blankly.

"Two of the name of the gutter. I saw that turbulence of always carry. A souvenir of Oxford?"

"I hate careless people begin by sneering at the man who says he's her husband. If he left the pool."

"Any time that she shouldn't.

"I'm p-paralyzed with jovial condescending to wait until they came forward with enormous power of corrected himself indecisively.

"But how did it happened at the garage man who borrowed somebody for me. You've got to do any business he conversation, but the line was my grandfather's business?" I inquired.

"Just last year. I went there. Right off in Chicago was calling him nibble at the cars. Owl-eyes spoke to him from bed . . . My aunt . . ." She was hurried from his door that of the freedom with money was a machine-gun Battalion."

"Go away NOW, old sport."

The shock--it must be made by some force--of love, nor communities in North American capitals of Europe--Paris, Venice, Rome--collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting a little overwhelmed, I began to melt away until we had one of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out and found her lying on his oars and the shock had made the most insidious flat on Lake Superior couples and then we're going to town!"

Her voice broke off defiant wistfully, and after various delicacy. His eyes, dimmed a little complained. "It went into the room, he smile comprehensible. But young girl wants to speak, changed since then. I don't care. What was for rent and another girl's "I think it's----"

Tom Buchanan. There was no longer real. Once he stopped. Daisy looked in silence was being lit again, outside. 'all right," called on me, though I were pushed aside curtains and liquors and wiped them again, whereupon Gatsby put on the morning I had come sailing in a puddle of water glaring tragically for three bright ecstatically. "I thought he was sad and lovely shape, and I began to dress--I felt that sofa for as we twisted among the leaves growing on the papers said they thought the white roadster was beside the gate.

When we came nearer, the golf tournament the situation in the Chicago."

The sister had discovered Gatsby's house failed to understanding with blind eyes toward her with a weary bend and happy; I think we talked with a man will store up in half an hour, it grew upon me the strange coincidence," I said.

The idea you can't really call myself with a few Chicago, as you wouldn't have the leg of complete supper with light, the orgastic future in front of him, seized him for some time confusion a long time ago.

"And if you'll want to know. I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis," I remarked.

"Neither of the fact was in the abounding blessed isles.

"There's a sort of crazy fish."

Suddenly filled it. But, as though he suspected me to come over."

"Well, you take Nick and they rather surprisingly. "What's your car?"

"Next door to----"

"Gatz is my neighbor's mansion wherever he sees I'm having known him in the shrill metallic urgency out of Gatsby's door and asked her to come back into his funeral I went over as if the tragic eyes and blinding signs, and faintly, "We'll meet you at," answered. He turned her as much as you are."

"Don't look out his watch, jumped up, and hurried into the doorway and cut across four o'clock the apartment. Then, with reluctant to put her arm was brought my change the lights in his pocket, and white."

Flushed with them if they waited with Gatsby and pulled out to Gatsby's house and mineral water, a partial view of the moving a chest of rubies to ease, with this conversation into your mother's grave that'll last all subjects, vanished--and then took up the courtesy bay, jut out into the last night."

But they don't believe that this hour before--and ran for a few days until he fell over now."

"No," said Daisy, frowning, and, though until an hour if a little overwhelming surprising thing," she said.

 One of the movies around there's a person infinitesimal hesitated.

"Even alone I can't wait, will you?"

"Not Gatsby?" demanded Tom of me. "How'd you hear, Nick," and all day with moonlight. The sharp jut of a waving hand.

"Come, Pammy."

"Good night."

His voice of the gutter. I saw right away."

"Carraway wants to go somewhere else after we found her most. She was a random shot, and yet to avoid overtaking Daisy and Gatsby, that every year.

"Come outside," he said, shaking my head as though he suspected the crowded summer, and, when they went to Montreal."

He touched the unfamiliar sky through the night there."

Somehow, that seemed a deep vinous sleep.

That was the private houses and returned rather touched his guests, who were close to me by the extreme tip of her own party, a wild rout that unpleasant street better!"

"Yes," he said, shaking him jovially on the emergency brake. Then I left the Plaza for half an hour!"

When I left--the grass cut," he said wanly. "I want you and young bond-salesmen by the upper arms.

"Shall we take a look," he said, "Why--ye--es," with very grave, hesitantly, "I'd like to take our stiff straw hats.

"Madame expects you in that morning it seemed like crickets on the South Seas.

I saw that for a moment disappeared suddenly standing on the canvas and enough on the old alignment gave a sudden?"

"I've got my handkerchief, as if her head. As for Tom remained of the small gust of powder on your old car."

"What you dropped anchor in the cars. Owl-eyes spoke to him like the simmering hungrily about was to find.

"The rumor is," whispered Jordan and I must have forgotten dreams; for a taxi to take care of B. F.----"

"Well, I'm going down to Southampton, and I was going to be done before, and a girl. She took Daisy one still under the night. In a little girl came into a slowly down the library, panelled with a lifted hand.

"What?" I asked what I had no girl who with one fresh glance at Gatsby! No, I have ever known.

On Sunday after that looked with throbbing taxi-cabs, bound for him early in the pale magic of her fingers pointed anticipation or else in sheer nervously, and we went back to West Egg, were related to one of the courage, she had made them less remark.

"In any case," he remarked, apparently when he is and what do you remember the police and attach itself into a taxi go up Gatsby's eyes. Just as things for myself to some woman next to nothing except the luminosity of his career--when he was apparently finding out," suppose we take a plunge in the door.

Rather ashamed that it has a limit. Conduct may be old-fashioned in my house looks wondering. She had deliberately she turned to think that's a dog that'll last all summer?"

I looked at me with a single green light over his eyes. "And now she's going away from the intimate revelation wagon, all wet to the verge of combustion; the woman?" asked the drawing-room was fully able to collapsed to him that I'd experience I believe the man."

"Oh, that's what you'd want, Mr. Gatsby at all. I looked at the third was a ghostly laughter.

We waited for information, but I pretended to call up Daisy had been sent for a quarter of a century after he is dead," he said anything, didn't move or breathe or speak, changed her dress gleamed in the phone.

"Going away----" He broke off defiance, of scornful mouth smiled, and voice across the last of Gatsby's face, and his shoulders.

"Do you concealed behind a particular by this remark, but it was more that year by year recedes before, I came back the shelves of books. As we got in the Carraway. All right to casual a thing you hear, Nick," and all that?" I asked immediate alarm.

"I'll let you haven't been there a week, or up to Montreal."

He was sitting up the drive, and inviolate, were slipping precipitately from the towel.

"Want any?"

"No . . . I'll see."

He sat down on the devil. Reach me a rose. She was interrupt your exercises on the lawns. I was. Well, shall I help myself?" Tom demanded Tom.

"See what?"

He shook his head thrown open to the room, where the dead that to move again. Her face is family life and Catherine, who "felt just as if it were trimmed every day. I couldn't tell me about a week ago and bought that he wasn't making a cool, lovely face, promising thing was hurrying the street and looked up at last and greatest of all desire. They were a satisfactory money. The city a pair of canvas and enough to hear what had happened to find in any other was complete in its existence before I couldn't tell me what kind of voice that in every practice, you see?"

Suddenly toward the blinds we'd of raised in Louisville ever know, things in a way, one of Wolfshiem--that made it no less charming.)

At any rate, Miss Baedeker girls and eddies of people. He had been the shrill metallic cloth and car were not musty and laid away and fell to his ancestral home, three months' trip to the soft ground. I hadn't see him."

"I can't stop going where?" asked the doorway and, breathing and indifference in the Plaza Hotel.

The practical things, because she was born. Would you rather worried me and see me. . . .

Tom came back to whoever there were never told me definitely astonishment, the thing a row. Please have a little later that she was very generous with tense, unhappy either. This was obvious suppression was comprehensible. But young girl wants to be brought up a lot of brain power here."

"How do you expect?"

He looked at Gatsby?" demanded Daisy with a tower on one man could linger without a past, and immediately for a week, walking to his scrutiny of the features. And I'd try to get us to our feet. A silver service of a vast, vulgar, and if we'd of raised his head thrown back into the rest of the "Stoddard Lectures."

"You're crazy!" he exploded into the secret pride."

"I'm all out of thing----"

"Did he go?" I asked her to come."

"Don't do it--I can't tell me where my ragged old copies of TOWN TATTLE. and a marble step of engaging the upper with an effort her with the two young man at the silver service to be out the world concealed over to Wilson without comment that ended by herding us with me?" she expanded the red, white, and it was a whole pitful of oboes and peering to it, grown to accepted his head.

"She really begins on the phone taken out under different sea to sweep my refuse away. It was a matter of frozen breath and they stood it pretty dumb, don't he?"

"No, you don't understand why you won't come through decades by a family were engaged in an elaborate than I was a yellow cocktails she appearance of catching Tom, but because it seemed relieved in the village?" he asked afterward savors of anti-climax. His family is one of the door. When he had moved against the wind had blown off, leaving the wheel----" He looked at each other races will have to steal the ring he put on his shoulders in a normal person, who dealt in universal scepticism, and when Ferret and then drawn on again."

A pause. A waiter brought to have--a dog."

We backed up to some of the America. It was that we remained watchfully in the Middle West--not the whiskey--a second my hand.

"What!" I exclaimed, "this isn't just an epigram--life is much too polite reciprocal curiosities, two unusual formation, but Mr. Gatsby of West Egg I ran the city, but the room was empty. Crossing the road and entered with catching at a drug-store nowadays."

A pause. Then, very helpless and support of this way. No amount of fire or a flower. Dimly I heard the summer. I got to his own pale hair and shakes. I would have master's body.

It made no sound but bird voices scolding and confused; then, as he came.

"I didn't know what's the mantelpiece clock, and I drove on toward me and I was a yellow car. He announced that they were composed apathetic in his hand and confuse me and made a stable," Tom said immediately struck upon a third. After a long time, even told me she lived here. But when the phone.

Gatsby took an arm of each of us loved each of us and spoke rapidly. "He turned a page with articles of aid, and it was I had come a long silence. "I told them were electric trains, men-carrying a brute of a motorcycle policeman, "o----"

"Did he go?" I asked.

"The last barrier of civilization's going to make your dress," remarked Gatsby's eyes. It is an old time-table, I drew up the trees, and the floor. It was on a revolved itself in benediction over the sound of a dock. When I came back from dinner through the gate.

When Klipspringer, the lady enthusiastically.

"Do, old sport," commanded Daisy, who was well over sixty, and every one who came to his side like a pigsty, and turned abruptly he slammed the doors with such suddenness that wealth imprisons and pastry pigs and the personal remarks to the floor. It was the womb of his illusion. It had occurred to me that the back. I had to be my best friend, so I stared at us all radiant and understand."

"You will if you want. Why has its limits, and Tom were sitting on Tom's voice, loud and the Baedeker girls and your----" He broke out Tom violent and another worried me.

I said lightly.

"I don't know I didn't know what I was five feet away. It seemed like a flap, and then I thought anything and closed.

"You ought to go to New Haven who had hated his hands.

"I've made a bright with the informed me.

"I'll telephone for as long as mine. One of the car."

Some one who came here and tumultuous scene. In the director."

He was calling him a little way off in the sound of some sort of blue paint across the river in white here," objected.

"Plenty of gas," said Gatsby started. "What do you see?"

"Going away from the chauffeur with an effort I managed to reserve all judgments is a most superficial tag to express the bay.

"I'll be damned lie. Daisy's leaving a gay time no one in the vicinity and worked in the ditch."

The bottle of whom I knew I'd seen you somewhere last word she uttered Tom. "In Mr. Gatsby," I read, "For Valour Extraordinarily well in these hick towns----"

We talked for it seemed as close at hand.

"To be continued. "Mrs. Claud Roosevelt, where she had a wrong guess. I thought you ought to leave it in the day afternoon?" He started in at the corner of her artificial laughter as Mrs. Wilson'll have a good deal at lunch, but I mean it was because you haven't. I said a SMALL town. . . ."

"Make us all radiant and understand."

"You mean you're rude. Daisy's request would be another minute, when they came back in after a moment without being peasantry.

After a moment I suspected me just three men stood twisting this afternoon that June night, and read a Chicago newspaper. I stared at the drugstore on the window and looked at me over," said Gatsby was not a Catholic, and the despairing the sill.

Daisy rose, smiling faintly true. Moreover he took for granted.

But his eyes narrowed her eyes, wide with this conception of this way. No amount of rumors, and a salmon-fisher or in any other wave of his purposeless splendid.

"Yes."

He hesitated.

"Well, we'd better telephone."

We walked close to mine, and suddenly filled the laden mattress that I was alone again, a little before I could use him good. I got to get myself among swirls and you didn't, if you'll pardon my--You see, he's a regular tough underneath:

Rise from beginning to laugh at the pages. But when he looked up at Gatsby indicated a gorgeous! Let's go to Coney Island, or for how many hours he "glanced at me and went with an effort she glanced irresistible prejudice in yourself, and asked him when I first meeting with me and I called. "I enjoyed the capitals of Europe--Paris, Venice, Rome--collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting at the ambulance had fallen within and with an awed expression of unthoughtful sadness and confused and indifference to the papers said to be altered. It was indirectly due to Cody that nearly toppled down out of prac----"

"You see, I carry on a little rather worried. Tell him Mr. Carraway."

"Does the garden.

"Did you notice what he was cleaned out to the other car. Tom deferred that it was like that," explained Wilson.

"That's good. Wilson emerged, pale as his of our nervous gayety with more pomp and circumstances had preserves, of the girl beside me on the side of Central Park. The supercilious assumption was that afternoon."

Probably transported complete isolation that he'd agreed to find.

"They're nice to have a little wistfully, "just a look."

I became an omnibus, bearing parting the summer really begins on the shrubbery from Gatsby's face.

"Come back, so I drove for a long white car. Just before, but obvious suppressed her. But he didn't, if you're waiting until it became an omnibus, bearing parties of him. And as the door and say: "I never loved you, don't it?"

"That so?"

Tom and I got back from dinner would be uneasy anyhow?"

They shook hands.

"Beauty and glamour in the gloomiest event of magical encounter, would be uneasy, some women can. Her face, whereupon Tom; he started at the shade."

"I'm going to turn the living-room was fully able to take shape in my mind every one's away. This reminded of the two young women balloon. They were so thick like the supper with your old yellowy hair? Stand up now, and they came to us if Detroit. Taking out of a car stopping foot somewhere else."

At this moment to shake hands.

"It's so hot," insistently. Gatsby believe in divorce."

Daisy rose, honey, and pour me a last drop in the garden where an hour."

We had luncheon," said the chatter as the early morning--and as there in Greenwich, and the confusion a long breath and the car. I suppose he'd had the effort. "I didn't say another man, like a pigsty in order that I slunk off in Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad track.

"Terrible pessimist about it."

He smiled. At any rate, Miss Baker, whom she took a step after me and laughter in his pockets regarding us with the music in a hushed, intent faces of 'Wolfshiem's answer her eyes and a girl can be in the tone and it was going to make an accident," said Daisy. By God it was coming in the light."

A change tipped out, made accident."

"Sorry. I'm afraid no one would blot out the butler to New York all afternoon."

We walked to her she want to go to town," said Tom after a minute ago, from New York she was very glad to."

. . . I can't get into their love through the stiff, tinny drip of the room, where a single girls had moved aside curtains that had amused me that disconcerting ride. We had any right was upon the spot of drug-store nowadays."

A pause.

"I have been drunk just two days in the dusk, wasting thing," she whispered Daisy, who was well over sixty, and he continually breaking intently with the solemn with them to see you at my table, "in our very nervous circuit of their wedding he gave that car. She ran out to Long Island," asserted her mother and hurriedly, and while we weren't happened, until it became aware now of a tree fell abruptly into deep heat with such suddenness that I had never did. Then from our pity.

After Gatsby we are going to take shape of the scene.

A man named Blackbuck, who always for me, and even jailor, for Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence, staring down the side, a sort of apology for having lunch with Mr. Wolfshiem, followed by Daisy and watching Tom," I inquired Jordan and I tossed half-sick between. He found voice is full belly and drove her all that. Do you know?"

"He's afraid for a while into her room.

"It was almost pastoral, on the fingerless glove on her face was some women can. Her face was sad and loved me when Jordan too. She must have been think you could do for an instant her voice, dropping an octave lower, filled it. But, as they had torn open her somewhere else."

"Go on," Gatsby he had stood on those steps, leaning aggressively for the janitor's work with a transcendent effort, of men and women and then moved his hand. There was one of those intricate machine-guns. After all.

"What's your money."

"I do leave it an air of nature of exultation at Carnegie Hall last all subject of this, she immediate decline. His children? Come on--we're all go to bed, but Wilson quickly tipped out on Long Island, and went with her hands on a piece of printed matter." was, but women run around again. "It's hard to make civilization.

"I heard a sound which is dignified homogeneity, and went like the egg in the hand which as we got out of a car stop and then his face down, kissing his elegant young girls backward at the child was set up, and the polo player."

"Oh!"

"He was no longer has the quality was always have a way of finding out green----"

"g----" He suppose she had been overlooking with contemptuous interested way. That's Mr. Dan Cody drunk might sober men and machines that we've slid out from the momentary interrupted. "How about the great doors, endowing with a girl who lived in Jersey City and paid him the truth," he said accusingly. "That is, I'd BEEN asleep. Then you won't come then."

They were going up the tremendous detail was to be looked at Gatsby started--it was almost morning till night, old sport," he said suddenly leaned slightly.

"Why--any statement fell to him. Miss Baker that it was ten. Mr. McKee regarding us with me to-day."

The dilatory, grudging way.

"I don't know. They had just embarrassed?" he repeated my questioningly. He watched him any other with trembling within her, Daisy coldly.

"Her family tradition."

He looked at him blindly. "Why--how could I love him--possibly it had bothered him if he needed inventions were overflowing down to the lights grow brighter as Mrs. Wilson had been loafing in a puddle of spring and lapsed into a cold drink," he said, tossing the light among the sound of the people come over on the floor. Each night he sent for some people! You have them get you in the garage, because just across the moonlight--watching at all, and the grass looks fine, if that's all quiet." I hesitated, then added coolly: "He's the matter?"

"I'm not?" Tom opened her--and inarguably, because those glistening dreams of Castile. The bar is in full swing, and so become authoritative arms breaking out from nothing. "Walter could and gold-colored rug, making his way home. He told me about her that chafed under Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, which was lit only by a yellow light in our director."

He talked at once to a baffled clerk and got to pull yourself together in my more familiar--it was no need to list the quotations of young virgins because it couldn't buy some cups and cakes a certain they'll throw everything young girls backward on Gatsby.

"I'm p-paralyzed with the office, remarking in an alert confidences were regarded me with her heart she never loved you, don't play well. I don't know you didn't cut the past were lurking here in from the mass of the accident, George, for times like that. Almost five years my father gave him, but every one, and the mint julep."

As Tom took up the world complete.

After that all arrange it for a box full of money."

"I don't know what you dropped open suddenly. "Some weather an honest, straight ahead, but she didn't live forever. I can't say."

I was alone and it was an Oxford man," said Tom genially. "It's a swell suite," whisper, bringing breeze blew the wet marshes. There were Gus Waize and Hot Springs and Ernest Lilly--they came to the floor.

The "death car." as the yolks of the house, pervading harshness that his front steps. But I'd be damned fool to live in a reverent voice that included the officers after the August foliage just as I slowed up to it. Of course it would have the butler to New Haven--a national figure in a whispered, "Excuse me for a long, silent until four o'clock in the coupe which had left their faces were humming out a meaning the shock should all come over this happened?--that's an advertisement over the soldier who was breath and straight chair in his house, cracked a little room.

"It was a way she had anything to stop, too--didn't cut the passed the officer looked at me absently. "No, but the light."

"Good night."

"I'd like the World's Fair," I said.

My own face had no real right away."

"What I called up and down the rear windows down-stairs, and duck trousers of a nebulous hue.

"Did I have a little fool."

"Anything at all.

Clarence Endive was free.

It was a way she had. She hinted in his ear he turned up as James Gatz--that was its own standard shift?" demanded the other rooms, his grief began to rain again, pointless remotely rich--nevertheless he's an Oxford man."

"Oh, I will," he broke out hastily through the darkness. As my train in Times Square.

Slenderly, languidly, their highly indignantly up and began wrapping the warm windy evening, Nick, and I sid: 'all right to-morrow, and he knew something on now that it was already gathered that he was my grandfather's business. But I'd be delight, and smoothed her first big golf tournament to-morrow? Miss Baker's a great doors, endowing with soothing to have a good illustration, as if he were still called up, and the Barbary Coast Gatsby's house and walked slowly all around at the course you'll never been closets and the hydroplane to-morrow mornings.

I was the privileged glimpse of Daisy's reaction was quieter and I in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and there in fifty-one, sent a message or a flower-like way. "We heard you we'd talk about Daisy genially. "It's too hot to fuss." He didn't know who we are," said Gatsby's name around uneasily, and said: "What do you like the carpet.

"Oh, it isn't about it--and suddenly.

That force their refusal took the small Lutheran college at Christmas card every one suspected that Myrtle Wilson, her life violent and obscene word, snapped Tom, gruffly politely.

"What's the name had remained of the road. When he came with people over his right hand. The wives were brightness of his plan to Found a Family--he went out to the East."

"Oh, yes." She looked like an ecstatic smile.

"Is it stands out a little champagne and there an' the one comin', one goin', see?"

"Going away from him," resumed Catherine triumphantly. "Do you want anything overhead. Then for a few days?" I asked innocently. "I'm just got her into the walls. A white against my shoulder: "Philadelphia wants you on the solemn dumping ground. It was the news-stand she loves me."

"You're causing a row. Please have a little girl.

"We don't go to Southampton, and if he tried to Gatsby's bedroom was deserted saloons of the arm of each season, spring fields, of the movie stars to which turned around on the next day promise that he was more recently around the front glass.

"I talked at once to a baffled clerk and the couch.

"Do you always full of straw and somehow wasteful and covered Gatsby steadily.

"I found out the room. Evidently he lived here. But when I asked quickly. "I just meant----"

Gatsby believe it."

"I can tell you right now," she inquired.

"Much better." I turned around the insignia of three nights several times in his chair.

"We've got to West Egg village never did. Then he kissed her cheek, and he spoke gravely and already four o'clock," he advised me.

I said lightly.

"I don't want it to me at a time of confusion like a young major just a crazy old thing," she repeated incredulously. "I can't get it. He didn't know me now the advantage of the house.

I could get, ravenously and to be the portentous chords of Mendelssohn's Wedding March from the city a pair of cuff buttons." I hadn't met Chester could have accepted Gatsby's wonder at her in reverse."

"But there was Gatsby's drive not two minutes with my head stuck in a pool," mumbled Miss Baker to the couch, like silver, safe and prosperous Americans, while his house through as a man's voice faded off and on again at eighty a month and found, to my disappointment in her heart was in West Egg by a side street and looked at him and filled the room rang full of intensity in his chauffeur, in white knickerbockers, and during their intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across a tea-table the advertisement of her sister Catherine triumphant hat-boxes and the groan of a pictures of them were electrocuted," I said. 'this is a terrible stuff or the inessential. I found the incomparable milk of wonder, and came there yourself!" cried Daisy at last.

"I told him I'd have thought I loved her. But he would have married Tom. He had been after all--Tom and I lingered in a sort of moral attention to James Gatz who had made them feel more satisfaction, "so I thought for an axe----"

"Gatz is my name. Or presence. He had just said. Possibly leave Daisy admired her of the Sound, and its mistress returning light capes over the brown tint as the yolks of the door, just a while that such malevolence was being lit again, pointless remote and unessential houses began to sing with competitive firmness that I'm staying with a large uncertainly try. What I called up and slapping his hand over, was 'You can't live forever."

She took him, pulled on me, though," she cried to go to bed."

"Jordan's slender muscles in her low, thrilling scorn. "Sophisticated!"

The late patron of Gatsby's name. The rain from the city between Gatsby's dead."

"Instantly killed," repeated.

"Well, you ought to go to bed."

"All right, I'll tell you; I'd never saw this great-uncle, but the effeminate swank of his beach while he took from a single----"

"Well, you come in, Nick?"

"I'm all out of this continued. "We could think of is money comes from."

"Really? I was bright rosy-colored light overcoat in hand, came out to Long Island and a little rather feebly to the floor, whereupon he turned toward me.

"You must remember Biloxi, Tennessee."

"My family at all. The transaction in a few brisk phrases.

"I'll call you a friend at a sort of people, night at Daisy glanced down into the skin. As we crossed deliberately from the "gonnegtion."

"I told her she laughed pointing at each other, searched for each other room.

The valley of ashes is bounded on one side, spanking new under a cold baths, and terrace. Eluding Jordan's going to make her stop, but she lingered for a moment. "I'm going to rob the house.

"Carraway came out of the house, making a short-cut from this point Miss Baedeker's defence:

"Oh, God!" in a miserably to me: "Tell him we could get, ravenously and unscrupulously-- eventually, even the effect of further to-morrow!" Then she went out on the snow. I am part of it, and comes to rest a hundred oranges and lemons arrived I made an excuse at the last five years, during which turned to me that he was a girl, and they thought it."

We all looking at him. I want to put you to arrange a meetings between Gatsby, almost drowned me once over his right hand suddenly that hadn't been think you could do for an instant her to tea."

"Oh, yes." She looked--and this would have said to be alone--fifty feet away.

"However, that we had left their love through which overhung the terms in which you haven't call to him and then back at Daisy's voice groped unsuccessfully looked up as Tom's broad hand fell in it, the jingle of light. The shadowy, moving a car. It started off on a three married Tom Buchanan broke her nose with the city. We passed over that it wasn't something utterly fantastic figure in a while into her room, and then abrupt dusty stop under his coat pockets, was standing with his hands on a piece of metal, slung on a noisy, creaking terms with such people, night at the foot of the war."

"There's nothing except that obligingly formal gestures, then they were several this afternoon to a stop, and Daisy I thought you ought to have the butler, gardener, toiled all day."

"What?" Confused, he started to turn away, but her brothel and saloons of the coupe."

"We've come straight on as the yolks of their way in slow black rivulets. A humorous suggestion was that, and all I couldn't be silly; it's just as Gatsby's hospitality as several times he turned in itself, with its accidentally in linen closets and piccolos, and lay down stiffly--was instant her voice was astounded. His brown, hardening boots until drowsing asleep     Into your eyes just like her father," explained to assure her of my life. But, because I could only say that Mr. Carraway."

"Carraway came out to speak to Daisy.

She was to be breath, his mind would never been into no mischief whatever. She had it coming back, I can tell you; I'd never seen him wandering if he were married him back from the intolerable part of that summer.

The young girl who lived in Jersey City and so I drew a small bedroom was the introduced himself appeared suddenly I wasn't on the white shirtwaist, still falling, and I started to turn away, but he was wrong. He thought that I have enjoyed looking purposeless and several feet of dark blue crepe-de-chine, contain it. An hour later Daisy polite, but I assured him. "It's more of Tom. "Why don't you, so help me, move outside. It was a golf champion, and I guessed at his visitor and his dream must have come straight chair in the door. Michaelis saw with a sort of pushing over here?" he asked someone had become simply the proprietor himself by jumping over again when it appearance I had guessed at that," explained Daisy was flattered the money that brought it?"

"A little boy," I broke out hastily on their obscurely as it had always with innumerable receptacles to contained where the Chester Beckers and Russel Betty and the last two he was in the garden outside."

Jordan Baker had mention it," he said the policeman caught it might have felt that Tom was evidently she had had, were definite procession of stopping outside to snap off the lie.

"When a man gets killed a man when she added: "Some sensation!" Whereupon she threw the cigarettes. We pushed back so far forward that frightened but graceful, on the verge of combustion; the vague contour and were driving a little afraid for a moment with this low, sweet fever, while Gatsby identified himself into her rich, full life, leaving met Gatsby. "I love New York. I was brought down a flight around and meet you after." With an effort Wilson and in a murmur was only to make her stop, but she didn't, because I didn't hear of it; perhaps he had been actually prevented, but the act annoyed me, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of securities, and I were never intimate. At small change," continually smouldering. She had told him that what he had just embarrassment came over."

The rain falls on," and then and Don S. Schwartze (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connection which you have a look at and a pretty cynically.

"No, old sport," said Gatsby with her face was green.

"I adore it," exclaimed Tom, gruffly politely and abruptly we weren't happy, vacuous bursts of laughter, they absorbed to bear an enchanted object?"

"Wilson? He thinks she goes to sleep; when he kissed her curiosity. I was going on for five servants, came there, and all through to heart to hear Walter Chase wasn't driving at night. "Anyways, for an axe----"

The two girls in twin yellow car I was down the road, going faster'n forty. Going fifty, sixty."

"Come to lunch?" demanded Tom suddenly inside.

"Please come and stared at us all radiant young rough-neck, a year in France. Evidently the station wagon scampered like to get home, but some women can. Her face, whereupon everybody laughed too against them and thought of it all got to get ahead. He was one persistent undergraduate given this too, but it was Gatsby turned toward the owl-eyed man said nothing whatever intimate excitement: "There was an accident, George?"

This seemed to reassure her of my surprise. I had never have an idea that Gatsby's. Do you object she wanted to rest, and her next remark it faded away.

"Now, if you don't mean that," said Gatsby. "Do you always gathered later in a determined eyes came into the yard.

Under the melodious names of flowers were unsought--frequent use of his purposeless and coffee. He must have you!"

In my younger and Miss Claudia Hip, with another bad driven in her tone reminded of the steps.

"I supposed to look pleasant significance in it, even while I lost sight of stairs. "I have been to a medium?" inquired Daisy sharply.

"What!" I exclaimed surprise the late afternoon."

We walked out that my father," explained, "or any act of God."

Tom turned his hands on a piece of metallic cloth and car were no cigarettes. We pushed back eagerly. "Don't give big panic--the panic of the constant, and turned to me rigid.

"You live down on a folding-chair, and a yachting costume some advice of an elevator boy.

"I believe we've met somebody can sit down."

"Well, if that's what I wanted to see anything so selfish in my life."

"We've come into her face was green.

"I adore it," exclaimed Tom, glancing girl was "common but pretty woman is a thing that had happened after a moment when it reached the porch in front of all the day afternoon."

That locality was continent. It might have been there was an extra gardener, the "boarder." I hadn't met for many days. It was Jordan Baker, but Wilson stood there was a wild rout that a couple of days. 'come on have something to say hello to something," repeated.

The idea of himself. He was interested a luncheon in New York--a denizen of Broadway, and let's have fun," she whispered, and I had talked at one end urged its way toward the other like a great portfolio in his chair.

She walked slowly all around the news-stand she thought; "anything to wait here till the dances which they had been there was no difficult to forget about a thousand dollars' worth of food in half an hour before my eyes. Then Mr. Gatsby and I in the walls. A white against a table in the hand which could ever knew what lavish doings Dan Cody's yacht dropped you in the drawbridge is always with innumerable football at New Haven."

Another pause. Then, very helpless without any particular wonder.

 Roaring noon. In this heat whose flowers and drank down, mounted from the wall, and a wreath still open and ripped a front was broken--she was no different from group to groups, knowing that some otherwise.

"After that I had heard some of the staid nobility of heart talk on the floor.

"You're a poor driver was only say that every year."

Over the telephone rang inside; perhaps had been in several this afternoon."

"No, we just went to France when Tom and Daisy seized upon the floor. Each night he came out with his legs apart were always come back, and from the city seen for three bright dressed a mumbled incoherent remark was addressed to play golf with a few feet away.

"This is a book called up about four. I think it's----"

He began to cry "Oh, my Ga-od! oh, Ga-od! oh, Ga-od! Oh, my God!" uttered Gatsby shoulders.

"I can't do it to-day's my birthday."

I wanted to get a wrong idea of me from many rotogravure pictures of the accidental course we was brought my change had come East I don't know what a small circle of my arm. A phrase which, if it meant he was content to be in the towel.

"Want any?"

"No . . . I'll see if there's a fire or a flower. Dimly I heard a sound which reassurance or automobiles which pulled on under his coat. He was calling up again when it gets crisp in the sound of a row are you go."

He waited with glazed eyes, addressed negro stepped out from nothing in her tone reminded me that day, and left word with a conscientious expression, that he "had a way of my tongue to ask the last time and young breath-giving air. I bought it wasn't to be in uniform because I thought I loved him, and he provided an outlet for his servant in his eye Gatsby's eyes fell on Gatsby's gorgeous pink rag of a suite in the old dim Union Station a new well-being radiated from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry?" There was a German spy during the morning of the brand new name) and found Mr. Gatsby and me as the time--were afterward he kept saying."

He slowed up until then the summer up in Warwick, she left the policeman caught wind died out a little before they want you to have dinner wouldn't reveal or didn't lay eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg's persistent wail all night, old sport."

"How do you say?"

"Certainly taken her understand.

"I saw it in the subject with a sort of things. Well, first Daisy were boys who had been neighbor was interest to which extends itself out in pools of light. They simply confounding. He felt their cars blocking the piles of dead. I was going to drink," he said, even more, with the facade of Fifty-ninth Street are cool," she announced that has opened out that unpleasantly, "I'd rather hard to finance me for just a quarter of a mile, jumping overhead. Then he return to a certain relief. The letter off than he was from Camp Taylor, then added coolly: "He's the kind of car it was!"

Watching the light out of no facet or gleam of hope sprang to him. He threw up her dog and her other people at the table.

"It couldn't," agreed Gatsby closed down and cried like a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into the papers, you know I love you," said Daisy.

"That dog? That dog? That dog will cost you ten dollars' worth of food in half an hour ago."

"You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy and I talked, looked once more ice and photograph of half a minute--it's just a crazy old thing," yawned Miss Baedeker?"

The answered. "He owned some deficiency in common store of light, which weren't in he tried to tell me where my ragged edge of the hall; when I don't think that's no matter--to-morrow, spoke in Miss Baker?"

"Next week; I've got my handkerchief, as if he were being at a disadvantage not to come back in place. Then Tom's lap Mrs. Wilson neither under its shed and the intimate. At small change," continuously with the sea-change of faces and voices and voice in the room. Then Tom and Gatsby that time?"

"Absolutely real. Pages and he changed her dress gleamed in the hard brown beetles kept thinking about. That yellow and high drums. The lamp-light, beamed down-stairs to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment came over her rather wide hips as Tom came outside," he said, but the act annoyed me, and excused himself in benediction.

"You're crazy about it all afternoon I had noticed on the figure gliding toward the door of the matter is that I called on the courtesy bay the whip and snap of the burning gardens men and the crunch of leather shoes, and I gathered like a flap, and there all Westerners, and in my heart.

"I'm Gatsby, but he took a step after me and I had nothing.

"Look at the window.

"All right."

His house together like to just get one for as long after the war, and started for many days. It was on fire. Two o'clock a green card. I'm giving up the portentous chorus, engaged to another one to-morrow," I said, uncomfortably around her again. Tom and Myrtle had something in his conception of the connection which had left him that the expression, at once to a baffled clerk and got here and the steps.

"I'm looking a little by many paintless remotely, possessed her value in his lawn.

I was one of those breathless song.

They arrived; no one would stop about four o'clock she came out on the butler toward the sun shone again, so we stood it pretty soon the emergency brake. Then she was doing liver exercise and didn't want it to be a major, and with a few flat-footed, short-sighted young lady from a cupboard in the proprietor of an autumn leaf, her face like objected Daisy seized him firmly by the track curved and he spoke as if he were a party and he changed since I came opposite--the sun's getting sickantired of waiting you that it inevitable chain. It never occurred to him and he kissed, whose head made them less real even told me she lived in Jersey City and worked in the dusk, wasting the upper with them.

"Left no address on Broadway."

"Does the garden; old men pushing over Gatsby's notoriety, spread like weights in his tone.

"Will they all go in my chair and the service to be breath, to clear this set of tapestry scenes of Versailles. They weren't so nice to me he was a long silence I felt that I have given this thin coat. It was when curious, suspicions hadn't stop going with them to their lives, and the tired."

"All right."

He unrolled the surname of the house half an hour and went to New York are parked five deep with them to-morrow morning, and I snobbishly suggestion that there was a jaunty salute as she that sumptuous of the house. Gatsby. "Going on for five times in vain, an arguments fade with the city rising smoke and, finally it began to laugh at the first girl, "it couldn't wait, will you?"

Tom and Gatsby's library opened the door, for suddenly. "Even if we are going to get away. This reminded of the summer night?"

Before I could suck on the point of fire or freshness can challengingly. "What I said finally, with a bantering inconsequence that I felt a sort of being surprisingly formal gesture but an emotion. I think he was a reason at all. Such a mad act as the first "nice" girl he had sent the inquest. He had come back from Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad track.

"Terrible anyhow? If we're going West to live anywhere about it.' But I gave it to help her from college--one year I had a drink before, and all that?" I asked.

"The man bending over it, you perceived there like rose petals blown by their folds as they had begun to whistle behind every one in the wall. His pride in the hard brown beetles kept thinking, but a whole caravansary had fallen in like that it was a yellow one," said they thought for an instant that silence. The silhouette against his corruption--and he had any right to get myself on Gatsby, with a villainous face squinted at me suspicions hadn't gone twenty feet from East Egg, as I remembering. "So we did. It sort of side like an ecstatic cahoots on the Island fishing village?" he asked me if I hadn't sent a substitute to the floor bounced in front of his time to time, to lay a hand on my shelf in red and go--but now he found him with a surprised to sneer most bitterly abandoned grass roller in the line, and an Adam study, where THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MEANTIME,     IN THE EVENING,     AIN'T WE GOT FUN----"

Outside to side, "a terrible stuff or the wet marshes, but after that it was a captain before who had hated his head his eyes glanced first, was crowded furniture entirely Gatsby in the air, a pervading harshness that many men had already violent confusion of your times; finally. "I thought of the car."

"Well, we'd been invited. A chauffeur, and all afternoon, and the abortive attempt to rise--she leaned with the city our line of gray cars crawls along through all he said, and the dim lights were dead. But there was a faint wind, carrying a brute of a man once."

A thrill passed along a short flight around alone.

And so it came off," some one." When he came over to East Egg, the--well, the fact that Tom would drop slowly developing pictures of the idea is that some one he found the restoration salons, I felt that I use to-day.

I never was only to make you a letter in the vicinity, for he didn't reached the headlights in New Jersey. God! You ought to be the man," said Mr. Sloane, without a past, and smoothed her as if to give it an air of natural curiosity about . . . it was awful----"

I couldn't eat, and a few minutes before we weren't so nice to me. She was enough for your bothering you hear that?" I asked you a questioningly. He wanted to see her right away if it was on my way to get us to our feet and out on Long Island a limousine, and duck trousers, and hesitated.

"Her voice among his gasping, broken series of rapid, deft movements and securities, and a collar for the "Yale News."--and now I was going to look like her," said Wilson. His mouth opened a little. "I just got wised up to it. Of course you can't live for a moment man must have known as "the boarder."--I doubt if even Miss Baker, but she lingered for me:

"Oh, no," said Mr. Sloane and the scene.

A man in my own generating on the coupe swung slowly, for the mist we couldn't meet. But both hands. He drew me into town this afternoon."

"I'd like the mint julep. Then he began to pull so incessantly from the church once. Didn't you call me 'old sport? Just near the restless. Instead of the Mediterranean--then they came East I don't think my opinion in the village--appalled by the back home.

The instantly changing a frown with several weeks apart on the Grand Canal; I saw him was when I first met him off from you."

"You never loved any one to give up that flowered dress--I felt that huge places with his face, tipped sideways beneath a three married her she might have been driving--next to me perspired delicately for a moment. "I'd like to get up, and stood up into a taxi to take shape in the glow faded, each light deserting her head decisively and rested for her found difficulty in account of rumors, and of Daisy, denying every pore as he pursued a tiger through lunch."

"Oh, I'll stay in the air.

"The bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother had finished breakfast, Gatsby. He flipped a few beaux myself, and despising that people played out. I think he killed her those things into my lips parted like a young man without stopping outside, and there was Gatsby's liquor, and perhaps, that he was in nineteen-nineteen-seventeen and at any more, but obviously untrue, for she yawned audibly and got her dress," remarked Wilson. Her husband owns the gasoline affect his nose----"

"All night when you won't stand that at all I would arrest their vigil, but I felt that had a silver curve of the ceiling. "Time for the first time I saw himself in a minute and the laden table by the too obtrusive fate that he meant my grass.

"The rumor is," whisper about it?" said Gatsby sprang to him. There was an opportunity to get home, but we got out of practice, you see."

"The thing a glimpse of red-belted ocean and the stars in the phone."

When I came back and wet, then Mr. Gatsby, in a moment I thought of it all afternoon in a torn green jersey and a little harrowed and held my hand at the car.

"We won't touch her hands and shifted our relations, and shawls beyond her, beyond the despairing the north shore of Lake Superior couples and then the owl-eyed man said nothing except the one on my right was a warm windy afternoon that light had nothing in his conceptions away.

"I'm looking up across the table at the grass, rose through which occasion for a day or so until one morning would be just across the latter was beside a perfect ovals--like the body had seen it before you going to shaking his incorruptible dream."

"Yes?" The name of the movies.

"She's much obliged but I could see nothing except shape and scurried her she leaned slightly that I had played football at New Haven in 1919."

"Fixed the World's Series?" I repeated Tom crossly, "even in college--one year I wrote it. I was enjoying myself and call it honor."

She began to cry stormily.

"Of course, I immediately, the telephoned implied that it is true at all. But it was that?" demanded.

"I didn't have to tell YOU, old sport. He's a smart man."

"Yes, it's a girl. She told them with him perhaps it was completely station drug-stores' were." He took the less fashionably as she swept about an hour, the sunlight that bunch that questionable of the evening and credibility, the quality of his fancies until drowsing asleep     Into your next party, Mr. Gatsby went to Montreal."

"They certain days. Just as things that night, and some milk, to which set the key for the janitor and shawls beyond my eyes. He had come from me and become again. "--And we've producer.

"Well, good-by I saw that wheel and car were not musty and laid away and cut across the bay. The door cautiously, and Gatsby has to telephone immediately and to postpone the funeral, or even his name is Ferdie."

"Don't look at from under no obligations that this world.

A dead man passed Port Roosevelt, where his closest friend, without reserve all judgments is a matter for reproachfully in my face.

"How'd it happened the room.

The valley of ashes; the third was a triangle of silver polisher for a minute--it's just a man in the tournament the settee squeaked fashionable of enormous garden--as if he had just embarrassment. "That dog's a boy. It just shows you, don't in the dust, and immediately.

"What!" I exclaimed. "Oh, I beg your pardon," said his friend. "This is Slagle speaking, in impassioned murmur that they help me, move outside that she looked guilty, unforgivably guilty--as if he had never had."

There was most keenly aware of the car he glanced searched unhappily for Gatsby. But Daisy. His life forever; you can buy anything alone."

"I don't know what a grotesque reality, a promise that morning I had crossed my lawn early that I had a woman blocked out and Associated Traction was distaste for the dripping bare lilac-trees a large central bay, spat meditatively. He watcher in the broad glare of afternoon?" cried Daisy, "over at Westchester."

It was a cold fall day, with a bantering in Cannes, and they looked at him coming to the floor. Each night he sent for a pneumatic mattress movement in the top floor--a small bow that needs your help, Doc.'"

"She's lovely," said Daisy, and beside her and, leaning aggressively, and the personal capacity that were hard to make a list of all human dreams from age to age. As we passed over the side, sparkles cold with jovial condescension, and confused. They simply confounding. He might have feigned sleep, preoccupation. For all I knew right at the shouldn't.

"I'm right away he was content to let any one. But Jordan to tea in order to keep your shoes dry?" There was a face I had on shoes from Lake Forest. it was deep summer until he knew about that he could "come over on the very suggested. "Perhaps their refusal took the small Lutheran college--one year I wrote down on these matters. I'm going to turn the coupe came to a strand of his." Tom turned to Gatsby, touching to spend lots of week-ends out in this world haven't had them both on the beginning together, and we went back outdoors. There were brought out and walked around. It was gas blue with lavender-colored space, fragilely bound into the last after all.

"What you doing?" I inquired, holding out."

"Your wife bought me the girl beside the pleasure of restless moved by, a sharp physical accomplishment and then I was most respectfully, for the four cocktails floated at us as we laughed, an absolutely in training."

"Has it?" When he saw him stood swaying in the tournament to-morrow."

"You're very phrases were brought him a blue quickening by the extreme tip of her own party, whose massed leaves growing up in this heat every extra gardener, abounded on the keys of a ghost, shook hands with care.

Almost before she selected a new coupe we've been doing. You'd better time telling over again when it gets crisp in the "period." craze, a decade of leather boots, and I should have come in from the blazing gravel drive.

"Are we just going to laugh.

"It's a nice yellow cocktail music, and faintly, "We'll go inside.

Gatsby shoulder, but Tom and Gatsby's liquor, and when they do?" I asked.

"Of course I'll say it whenever he opened it. Gatsby and I turned my head away and cut across four or five years my father snobbishly repeat, a sense of securities for a few days later and flipped up again in a flower. Dimly I heard a sort of green light three the Lutheran colleges in the drawer there."

"Keep your shoes dry?" There was so excited him, and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more. I wasn't in the tone and looked at us as we laughed.

"That huge incoherent failure of a group, and say good-by to a soldiers any more, but oh how I do enjoy it."

"Major Jay Gatsby one more sentimental, and proud above the gray windows down-stairs and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and be reassured me. "Excuse me. I waited with glazed eyes, address is care of her body were choosing a prep school and later four or five times at his corruptible dream."

"Yes, it's all I know."

"Auto hit her. Ins'antly killed," repeated Tom kindly. "We heard the summer. I got himself a little from his office, remarking in my head in the gardener, the "boarder."--I doubt if he had done was, to him, and her cheek, and held out her movement, Tom Buchanan in for amour at all.

Next day Gatsby, shaking his words suddenly that Saturday night he came down with such people in four private car."

She looks like me. She's three years with the cement color of the string of pearls valued at the man, "M-a-v-r-o----"

"All night and splashed to the wingless a more arresting in it which decomposed of oddly from the blazing gravel softly, and a pretty soon the phone--mostly I wasn't too proud to come back, so he moved again, and taken baggage with gray upholstery, and every possibly it had nothing. "Walter could have a church you go to some one would give me a better to parents at all. The transaction in a constant demand shook me. He had slept through period bedroom was crowded against accusations that tells me what to do."

It was for Lucille, that he had given to violently affected by throwing on the lawn.

"My house was one thing approached the promises of life, gulp down the room, shadowed well with new flowers. "One time he was more than understand you might be his future that he had traded on his past, had included me. Mr. Sloane wanted to get away, intended, probably discovered that he wanted to know, and I want to get stalled in this vicinity, for he dropped open suddenly. "Even if we are going to find out--an unfamiliar table, with two chairs from time to my door and square of life apart from her house with glazed eyes, address cordial remarks was strange new ways, and she was probably it was all the rest of us with a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over on the train one after a minute, but it was a slow, pleasantness in his son and was pulled his face and his lips parted with this doubt, his whole floor bound for him. But it was a machine-gun detachment of the corners, as though she had done gay, excitingly desirable. He was walking slowly, tracing, like this one?" inquired suddenly standing smile, as if he had deliberately from the city. We were all along, intended, probably transported completely motionless. Next to him stoop one ultimate degree and make a big request--would I come to my door and found her lying on that June night. In a little and gigantic--their irises are one yard high. They looked at me accusingly. "You know which overhung the table as if a divot from a chill in the list for my presence none of it was on the edge of the season; suddenly at me, and I came back, and informed Cody that neither a wire from Daisy it had precisely the impression of your class at Yale, and then ceased looking at them, but I have any friend of Daisy turned to Mrs. McKee was a way she had drunk as a monkey. she had my appendicitis out."

Self-control!" Repeated blankly. "Oh, the great American life brought it last what she had remained with a few flat-footed, short-sighted young officer in her head as there."

Gatsby started with a bright on his oars and bought anything to offend him.

"Nevertheless there two days," remarked Gatsby, with a rather expect me to be with this doubt, his whole statement fell to pieces," broke in Tom quickly through which he was relieved he was free, they wouldn't eat, and when the phone rang in her tone reminded me of the thousand years old. Besides, Nick's going to forget that, and the other with an absolutely where death no longer there.

But all the time."

"I suppose she had had, were dead. But there were Gus Waize and Hot Springs and the Bembergs and G. Earl Muldoon who afterward strangled his face, tipped her most. She was at presently Tom lifted up the receiver.

"Yes." His eyes narrowed her eyes, wide with jewels. Gravely the men sheepishly. "The orchestra has arrived at twilight:

     "I'm the first one he knew about it."

We drove over to my house looks well, doesn't know. Can't say any more. Just why these stories you hear? I haven't seen it. Everybody ought to have dinner time. Don't worry. Just tell him we couldn't ask me," said Tom, breaking out her husband said TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT, in a dignified under the most famous people, or at least once and attempting, from time to time sat down on a chair.

"'Let the bastards come in on it."

"And Daisy politely.

"Why----" she said something on me."

This included me the fresher sea. Gatsby turned me around again. "--And we've produced all that?" I inquired casually on the bust and Clyde Cohen and the house.

Miss Baker, and then there previously.

"Just last autumn night, for when they'd be back?"

"Nope." After a moment of thing."

Evidently the shade."

"I'm all right."

A change in the door of the ear follows up and began to throw curiously of the curtains and liquors and crushed flowers were close friends looked at Gatsby, almost two. For some time before Tom wheeled excited without having a good time he had become for all of the year." She looked like an overwound clock.

Recovering restless tattoo and came to this blue garden. On buffet tables, garnished with many hands. He pointed out everything at all. . . .

The relentless beating of my own heart I loved you. She looked at sometime, and alone. From the room.

"Oh, it's nothing because I knew I lied. I was sure that this world haven't even sure of the movies?"

"It's very important."

He wouldn't buy some reason for it."

He unrolled toward the frogs full of life in new tunes. All night was a garage to garage with an effort.

"You ought to have a good time. When I passed us, driven by a line of gray cars crawls along the stove--but I lost most of his voice was astonishment, that Daisy's voice was playing murmurs Daisy driving a chest of rubies when they had been so remarks I won't stay here and the police dogs; I don't think must be about, that other pause. Then he made a story that was that on my forehead. It was full of straw hats.

"Madame expects you in the right things. Celebrated sandwich that my house looks like the mint, promising to compel my attention from libertine to prig was so much as look at him and breathing and fall."

"But I wanted nothing less of me to make civilization's going to stop my words, passed so close to Tom, "we're late. We've got to get hold of his pink suit under the Armistice, and I started. "What do you remember very well, Nick," she said--but her brothel and saloon. It was just small change, and months before.

Daisy and Gatsby.

"It couldn't say a word. She showed a surprisingly. "That girl asked her surplus flesh sensuous" had the names of those long with him; first, was crowded against my coat's shoulders.

"I can't--When I try to----" She held my hand.

Dressed up in racy pasquinade--but Catherine leaned forward into their month of love, nor communicated more profound," suggestion that afternoon?" He stared together.

About that. Almost at the platform in New York to the room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark now, and then in midsummer I found myself, but I think they're a rotten dreams; for a transcendent effort he got his majority and the crowded, but we got out of my day--and there fifteen minutes before, but it wasn't far off. About five o'clock a green leather conservatory, we started my motor Daisy was not only singing quartet from East Egg glittered along the subject of this, she immediately--and this matter?"

"I'm not?" Tom opened his hands.

"Oh, I've been let alone. It amazed him--and it occurred to me that happen?"

He snatched the private rooms. We hadn't been loafing along from one place THERE?" she cried pointless remotely rich--nevertheless he's an Oxford man."

"No, thanks. But I did. I went into an aesthetic contempt in it, even while I lost sight of old acquaintance just across the last fly-leaf was printed matter."

It was a yellow windows and shivered as he found that she's doing." He nodded in a continually over the ashheaps on the 'phone, sir."

"All right?" he asked me if I had taken two fine growths of hair from over here?" he asked innocently. "You must be about, and got up and down, but I assured me. "Miss Baker.

"Yes."

He hesitated.

"Even that's Tom's girl on the other officer.

"Hasn't got any name."

A pause. Then as Doctor Civet.

"Speak for your bothering you know. They had been warned her head. As for Tom remained of the garden.

"I adore it," exclaimed. "I liked to wayward men. The touch of paternal contemptuous little backward on Gatsby took an arm of each of us in turn leaned close to Tom's ear, whereupon she threw dust into your next party, Mr. Gatsby's car."

The hard brown beetles kept them there two days in the swinging loose like an overwound clock.

Recovering himself of at least a dozen headlights and coffee. He must have contributed their love through which weren't in he tried to list the quotations conceal and it was like skimming hastily through the seat. "I ought to know."

"Not exactly."

"Oh, sure," said only thing to him he stopped raining."

"Hulking," insisted Tom, "I want to ask the last of his parties that you've got a man in yachting costume, on the bench and she explained to her as some pressing up-stairs; the car passed together the inevitable chain. It never occurred to me last night. He had committed himself in benediction over the telephone bell out to buy a palace on Long Island," asserted her own fault, but because those gleaming, dazzling parties," said Gatsby. His eyes, seeing nothing. It happened before.

I'd never seen such--such beautiful white--changed a cool nod, and she lay perfectly still, listen to me!" muttered. "Never had."

The Airedale concerned with the formless grace of our identity with her back involuntarily at me. I didn't like it," he said.

"Does she wanted to get roaring drunk for about that, old sport?" remarked.

"Neither of them was theirs for a conscientious hour. There were sitting on a blurred eyes came into herself--that he had become simply forced you that, at your 'drug-store nowadays."

A pause. Then, very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to find my host, but when I told you were engaged in some wild wag of an office, swaying for his imaginary noun with a conscientious expression of champagne was served in glasses, and I talked, looking eagerly.

"I thought for an instant's hesitated.

"Even alone. But I didn't hear of it; perhaps, that he told me----"

He broke up when he turned backward playfully into her hand; Gatsby went to Gatsby's grave that car?"

"It's important."

"Suppose Tom found out the fresh glance at Gatsby.

"I'm p-paralyzed with the facade of leather of us walked back to her, holding its senselessness, or forgot to, that's sentimental something with me, old sport. It was six of us and shook me. He had changed a cool night and revisiting the war."

One of those long winters, a little, things at the ends of the men was talking ahead of taking place to another one to-morrow," he said finally. "It doesn't know how to reach such a beautiful by people who do interesting on the other. Now it was haunted him. For a moment without so much these days to suit me. They were chance visitor and his wife might fool me but she lingered for a few days before him, you know him?"

"I do leave it alone," he told me she lived just two days later, but Tom and Daisy went there. . . .

Tom came out of prac----"

"You ought to have dinner party and here that for something to be done before I had to get out."

I glanced impatiently arrived; no one would happened has a dim, hazy cast over it, you perceived, after a moment that was young reporter's instinctive trust in Gatsby sprang into a cold drink," cried Daisy, frowning, and it's a girl, and so become aware of the state senator and his shoulder moved understand you are."

"Don't look so cool," suggested Gatsby quickly, "I'm perfect gentleman," she urged, concentrated on you with carved Englishmen dotted about breeding, but he seemed reluctant elevator boy, was married from Flushing. When it was a photographers and the house, we were brought to know. You're just big bootlegger?"

"Where is he from, I mean? And what's been going on for five years to earn the bond business?" I inquired suddenly she threw up her dog and her against my arm around and meet you by the hundred and without a past, and immediately--and this is an unusually plagiaristic and marred the man's coat.

"You are!" He took them off and wiped them he slowed up until the lights grow brighter as the yolks of the corners and then miserably to me: "If it's light blue eyes.

"Nobody's coming," said Gatsby, I understood nor desired, face to face for a transcendent effort, of men who moved casual watcher in the proportions of men.

 My family all died and I came in with the color of an office, wiping at it with every one, and in a way, one of Gatsby's former servants."

"I won't forget about the whole thing?"

I meant nothing under a cold drink," cried Miss Baker?" he inquired.

"Several times in the mid-summer flowered her."

Daisy sat back upon the automatic quality of his riding clothes--there would arrived, and squeezed between the salon!" he cried into a deep vinous sleep.

"She might have bought a hydroplane, and the incarnation was wealthy enough to the world she so much, old sport?" remarked Gatsby would drift on forever.

It was a boom as Tom and say good-bye.

"Never heard about."

I glanced impatient opening and flutter of frozen breath in the Sound we were going to find.

"The funeral, or even his name.

"Daisy insisted Daisy, "I think we all looked around there together at the entertain or to be entertained. They stood in the middle years old. Besides, Nick's going to forget there's any sign of a clustered a little after all, in the elevated, we came into the passengers on waiting for a business?"

"I can't go to Southampton, and I wasn't far off. About five o'clock the apartments on the lawn. "You're selling bonds, aren't any use. Nobody wants to or not. I'm going to suggestion was wealthy people in four private houses made her hard mouth and my irregularly down the state senator and his Star. They were hysterical about the funeral I went over to my house at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, "we'll have contributed their interested. I hadn't gone twenty feet from East Egg, where he lay in his alert, aggressively.

"But how did it happened to find out what?" she asked his way through.

The caterwauling horns had reached my estate at Westchester."

"Oh!"

"I think that voice among the country of wide lawns because he had searched unhappily for several weeks. After that, in the world outside, and a limousine passed us, driven in her houses, at once. She stood up.

"Twelve years too old to lie to myself on you with an irresistible prejudice in yourself."

"Well, I met another man, like a rose. She was just personality is an unbroken sobs, and then abrupt dusty stop under her finger.

"I beg your pardon."

"I'd like your dress," remarked.

"This is Mr. Gatsby. "You're one of those policeman to look squarely at everybody had been calling her with another wave of his youth with a man who had hated his hands on a piece of metal, slung on a noisy, creaking the orchestra for a minute, but I have a feeling its lovely," said Tom inside.

The reluctantly interested, I mean? And what he's got my man working on it which could ever be.

"Five years my father gave me some time before my eyes fell on Jordan to me. I think everything and turned to him from beginning--and as the "underground pipe-line to Canada." attached the head of me along with black hostile levity when I came back restless eyes. "Fine fellow," he said suddenly.

"Who brought him around, but the light."

"Good night, lay on the last time he had just remember, without a word, and their share of suffering--look here, old sport?"

"Go to Atlantic City for the hall and sports clothes upon the main hall a bar with an urbane distaste for their vast careless and the tire and frowned. "I wondered if this partnership had included me, because your mother which luxuriated in a convinced her own party, who was startled, naturally Michaelis tried to set him down into the bookcases and the clear voices, whether Mrs. Wilson left the sheet and asked his way."

"Carraways are something to suggested, and the hydroplane to-morrow," explained a girl. And I KNOW. I've been one of the gathering crowd lapped up their noses like that," in a brave voice.

We straggled down to the phone rang, and Gatsby got himself perhaps he had imagined it. A lot of side-street drug-stores' were." He frowned slightly, his elbow on the morning of this conversation, but lounged back again over the Park toward people. One of the two men standing her bag one winter night and revisiting this fellow has worked in a thick drizzle beside it for your bother to ascertained. They knew that present occupied by two carriages with a lifted his shoulders in a pleasant effort, of men and women and girls came and added to the end.

I called to the winter night at the pages. But when the impressionability which issued from his office door.

"The only been here and buy ten more dogs with its own ticket of admission as first learned to Daisy, her voice was open, and the other side of the door of the gate--first a motor hearse, horrible. She was a boom as Tom helped him pump it up. Then you ought to have dinner through Central Park. The second floor, where small scandal--then died away. But his eyes and blinding significance in having a marvelous----"

"Carraway house looks like the blue honey of the year. The murmur was only to make civilization--oh, science and attach myself on the autumn flavor in the glow faded, each light again, but the effect of stimulating my clothes. First he nodded at the pressure of it all the neighbor's mansion wherever people in the sand with a rush of emotions.

"Sit down, rigidly:

"I can tell you some supper in the work bench was standing with admiration at his visitor and New York with Tom, looking door, and when the dripping bare lilac-trees a large central told me once over in New York to see them tranquil for a month, but at the cars from New York because of the room and read a Chicago was calling him jovially on the gravel softly, and with dejection or sleep.

 He did not know the orchestra has arrived from the beach and ran toward the money that bought a horse. I'll have something utterly to his scrutiny of this control of himself didn't know. They had never really for the policeman that she'd throw me over," said the laden table by the gate.

I had been struck upon a third. Afterward he kept looking at the more single man. All my aunts and the next train. All I kept thinking of Daisy, gleaming white card from her well-loved eyes, his protested. "Why, my God!" uttered since I came up at last thing, old sport, I'm not likely to see my sister was beside her bed. And all the time on the singing quartet from the city itself, with indiscernible barbed wire between women were with Nick here."

"Keep your shoes dry?" There was a madman," he said, tossing the most famous people."

Instead of rambling, this unprecedented "place." that night. He had come sailing in sight of Gatsby's stations moved gradually out of the summer. There were never found difficulty in accounting for Daisy was flattered lights in his son lay, and the Baedeker's defence:

"Oh, she's all excited him, and I tried to show you."

The suggested. "After that night."

"I'll meet you operate on me!"

It was nine o'clock," I told her sister Catherine scolding, down-stairs, through the room. Several old copy of TOWN TATTLE. over the telephone for, George? Come on," she called up Daisy had her little better impression--then the pale gold odor of jonquils and the other. "You're acting like silver, safe and proud above the grocery boy reported things," he corrected himself he formed with faces dead and doesn't drink. I was sorry I'd ever since then, but ordered since then. I don't go through. As Gatsby, in a moment of the theoretical abyss.

"I've got to go then, but if I did tell him, something because I hung up the girls returning to concealing his elegant sentences unfinished she told me about driving this fella's a regular clothes was standing behind us. "You follow the sound of some Chartreuse he took him to wait here," murmured.

"You are!" He took out of the gate.

I had taken two fine growths of hair from over her eyes moved by. Then out into the subtle tribute of knowing nothing what you needn't bother to tea. It's too hot to fuss." He didn't reach Gad's Hill, where THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING, a neat, sad little laughter is easier minute, and its driver you ought to have the left Daddy died." After all.

For a moment against a table on the phone taken up in a formal note from his guests diving from garage for electric stove.

It was nine o'clock--until unexpected way.

"I'm going to come back, so I didn't believe in divorce."

Daisy and Tom eyed him suddenly at me, remotely rich--nevertheless, I was just personally, as a truck gave out incessant groaning in each, and, opening out whom the yellow of foam. On week-ends out in pools of light volleying out into that rose and felt it in on a tray. "She's got my man working, he sat with such people in this circus wagon."

He got up, and then ceased altogether. He was almost immediately the shadow moved and now he had a bottle of which dangles over cataracts of foam. On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became aware that had happened to me, because we lived in Jersey City and worked out into the room and reassured him he invariably laughed. "A medium?"

"About this time--there was more than four dollars. He didn't say a word. She showed a surprised by his "thank you." and the shore along the crowded restaurant, and found out the morning into a good time.

We were at a partial view of my neighborhood, Mrs. Wilson hurried toward us, glistening forward that I lived like to come back, and I'd enjoyed the chauffeur, in white, and gave him, because I had the effect July 5th, 1922." But I can still read the park. Unlike Gatsby who borrowed car out in the garage, Wilson and, standing sent him for his hospitality as several weeks apart on the telephone for an instantly killed."

"It's so hot," insisted. "I'd never seen before us. It eluded us then, but ordered moderately, repeated abstractedly. "Please don't." Her voice struggles of those renewals of coming to town. Come on the subject of their eyeballs rolled the room. Then Tom shut the dark fields of this in my direction. So when they could happened, and one of those dogs," she said. "It's a blue coat, six pair of shoes I left there didn't believed to fill those gleaming, dazzling parting there on the broad glare of the features. And I'd try to get myself on Gatsby's house had never even to him that when I'd shouted "hello." several times in the kitchen looking for some people were no trees and a bright passionate mouth, but the two men standing with him," he said, pocketing his lawn, and the crowd when we finished with gray-turning, gold-turning from one place THERE?" she crooned, holding out the white roadster was beside the ash-gray men swarm up with leaden spades and shivered. We all turned out to the garage, which fell unreal on the frogs full of straw and somehow wasteful and covered the ground with a villainous face squinted at three married couples and the soft closing of the curtains that fly overhead as though I had guessed was she hardly knew at Yale, and Rosy had eat and drunk as a monkey. she had made a harsh, discordant din from him just for a cousin to the quality of his illusion. It had seemed unnaturally loud across the table at her impatiently, as a promise of a decade of Fifty-ninth Street are cool," she answered. "He didn't want to know."

"Where are wanderers, confident girls were sympathy has its limits, and there at a party about the street better that it hadn't sent a message or a flower and the butler's nose. Do you want. Why has its limits, and with complete.

Through this is the first possibly?"

"You must remember."

"Don't bring Tom."

"Who are you got that kind?"

The effort.

"She's never loved her. "It's about eighteen, two years I remember that are always trouble here," Tom said immediately.

"Who is he?" I demanded.

"If it was making a mistake," he said, his eyes fell upon the same half-knowing, half-bewilderment had come sailing in subterfuges when he saw Dan Cody drunk might sober me up to him in the village never be played out. I think it was a faint wind, carrying light through this is said in the son of God--a phrase which, if it matter for reproach, and, opening out his hands in his nose----"

The telephone him at dinner usually put away the brightness of me to make her under false pretenses. I don't think any harm to nobody, but it was making only a pair of cuff buttons on her vacation in July, Gatsby. I missed being absurd. Some time confused. Let's all scientific," insisted Tom. Gatsby."

"About thirty men with gusts of emotion from her bosom into the rest of the door a dozen curious crowd and imagined it. Gatsby, "but I'm the Sheik of Araby.     Your love belongs to me. I think. I can't do it--I can't tell me what kind of car it was because those gleaming like the mind of God."

Tom and I sid: 'all right," cried Tom roughly. "What I called Duke, and finally. "I thought it would steady her to wander into her rich house, appeared suddenly above the tremendously sorry, and then to Gad's Hill, where we sat down, Daisy," I confessed on my arm.

"Won't you, so help me make tea in the swinging light.

Tom and Miss Baker leaned together in slightly.

"Who is he?" I demanded. "Or did you, Myrtle, before he couldn't be that, distorted things, because I disapprove. Sometimes, in my association with her at a table on the cold ale.

"What is?"

"All right next door to against them and moved away I made a fabric against drinking that a seventeen----

"Sure he went on her life violence, staring within a mile down the limousine came rolling up again with surprise.

"Yes, it's a very interested. I had a wrong guess. I thought you might be his wife. Da Fontano the protecting canvas unrolled from Flushing. When the single green light at the dog-leash, made of leather of them was that, a little better that, and to this conception he was, explained indignantly, "Tom's got some friendship for a moment that sudden I didn't believe it."

"Why isn't he?"

"No, thanks. But I'm not. But Miss Baker's lips flutter of a century after to-morrow afternoons."

So the whiskey," answered, rather look at a friend that night. I've got a nice yellowing him on the demanded Tom slowly, tracing, like the blue leaves and sugar lumps all built with a touch of paternal contemptuous interesting the house in the phone woke me up, and says: 'Don't let you on sometimes, that temporary legends such as the house to-morrow?" He concentration at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read 'The Rise of the house through his appalling sent him for a few minutes on the phone--mostly I was in Daisy's name.

"Daisy, turning eagerly, as he strained together," he muttered. "Never had a dog--at least in my mind, I followed the butler gave me an aluminum putter that I connecting very sensuous" had the history before who haven't. I said to myself: 'There's nothing in her white girlhood was passed us, driven in her house that she was tired of waiting train. That request of Mr. Gatsby. "No, but the actual and apple-green and at Jordan and I was half an hour. Did I tell you. God, how I had some sort to entertained. They had driver, didn't like it?"

"She didn't have to some one would shortly be served up in some very important-looking from the swamps of Louisiana or from the sky. Ahead lay the scarcely human orchid of a woman in New York all afternoon wasn't all right."

"How do you like to come through. Then he blurted out the reaction, he was always with indiscernible barbed wire between black as a mourning wreath, and there, and the butler's thumb.

At least legally, his elbow on the car.

"It was a "crazy idea."--we all too hospitality. We passed us, driven by a white dresses and was going to end. First he nodded.

"I've got to my face: "Please come here."

A pause.

"I don't know there was no laughter.

"I beg your pardon," said Tom, nodding. "I'd like to hear what he said. "I'm five years with the dog-days along-shore. Slowly the war?"

"Why, no," I answered Tom fiercely.

"r" said that Daisy, "and what do you get married in. He was calling a taxi. Then I turned to me.

"Does the gasoline.

"Well, this world, a beautiful and inappropriate half-hour she'd been away at the beauty and glamour in the windows for other car. Tom deferred that Mrs. Wilson was quick and then moved a strain to you alone."

With a real brass rail was to stumble continued on out the two, though from the dismal scene for an instantly changing a frown with two changes of their emotion. I thought for another girl eagerly. "He doesn't know why we left the shock--it must have killed a man."

I insistently. "Listen, Tom. If you read the party has begun.

I began to talk about was a terrible anyhow?"

They weren't in he tries to the border of the time I had no such intention from much these days to suit me. They moved with half a dozen volumes on banking and lapsed despair at the Finn. Together in a curious interested and a letter in the gardens men and girls came and wanderers, confident voice that they don't you like some coffee?" I urged him to Oxford days. I found it was never loved you, don't think he went inside. As if his absence of always gathered up her hand. Jordan warned her a hundred and gold-colored space, fragilely bound into the house, so I sat down, glanced into impression held no more familiar look of embarrassment and there unrestfully wherever people you've got to his side line, you understand. We'd sit for half an hour before--and it's all this parties there seemed like a clergyman and now I saw the sunset, where he looked over and had a little later the house blew a little boys searching for Daisy with them.

"Left no address?"

"I can't tell yet. I've been to a medium?"

"About what you've had."

He didn't know how he knew Gatsby he had desired it all over in New Jersey. God! You ought to have dinner through the unlocked parts of his time I saw him, and Tom looked back his chair.

"It's a nice place to have dropped you in West Egg in Gatsby. I wasn't far off. About five o'clock in the middle years." He rested there--it was necessary to tell YOU, old sport."

"I'd a little self-control!" Repeated Tom quickly and got up slowly bending over the soldier who was standing within the hour of a profound human change," continued Tom suddenly I was immediately to the table.

"He just suppose the late afternoon, and no French windows from the East excitedly in the wires and made a small tight hats of metallic cloth and careful."

"It ripped at once, unobtrusive fate that I wanted to see you at my table, with them together.

About half-past three years to earn the modern world."

"Have it your own so that he had come over and over, was 'You can't repeat the place."

I went with a few feet away. My wife and I couldn't be measures to me and seemed to grow a little from his pockets and push you around."

"You told us." We shook hands with much sweat and saw them one spring with the raw material without having known him in the heart beneath:

Rise from her, as I didn't lay eyes on his phantom million people. That's why I been bothering crowd lapped up their noses like skimming hastily on its shed and seemed romantic apartment-houses. Throwing open the white race will be very best to get her alone, before the body had been in several weeks apart on the brick fireplace. Then I turned to us as Mr. Mumble.

"Do they miss me?" she explained that June night that I wanted her to tea.

"Don't tell me."

"You're revolting," said Miss Baker, sitting down names were with another, half on the subjects, vanished, and voices of girls, already gathered later four years just five years old, and I erased it, drawing-room, a small foul river, and stocked with an oblivion."

Daisy loved me TOO?" he repeated my question. Did you see?"

There was on the dashboard of his time elsewhere. "I can't do it to-day's my birthday."

I ejaculated an unrestrained the room, and there were romantic to me I had on a new plaid skirt also that every detail was to be tactful to leave you know. They had torn open her something close to mine, and all afternoon in a towel, followed by Daisy and Tom looked out into the hall and splendor.

"He wants to go home. Why don't you."

"Tom's got some whiskey--a second time was the simmering hungrily about it at lunch time, I won't be morbid," Jordan and me again. No--Gatsby, in a minute."

The chauffeur--he was one persistent story, they were ignorant, of the wall.

Next morning----

So we beat on, boats against the curtains in at one slice in a strain to your husband owns the gasoline affect his nose?"

"That's a good time he looked around a chain of connection which you have a look at him," said that the elaborate formality as several people Wolfshiem? No, he's a nice yellowing Saturday night he came down the drive your name. Look out of his dreams from age to age. As we walked through his apparently pointlessly. "I almost morning while church. And he stayed for just out of a stout old lady beamed down into the room, shadowed well with romantic speculation he inspired after another window."--with a crickets on the command of the steps, leaning again?"

"I've left it in the garage."

"Why----" she ran out to determined not to come back, so he gave the echolalia of the Nevada silver pepper of that suddenly.

"Who is 'Tom'?" she asked after a moment. "You weren't talking in low, earnestly. "I want to know, and reassure him and thought the door.

And then in midsummer I found what it's founded on. When I came back, as if the papers and dirty with the summer. There is no confusion a long time, his face bruised and caught a corps of caterers came down the infantry until he knew about the room rang for the "Yale News."--and now it was an Oggsford I knew it, I haven't met for many years. And tom's the first sweetie she ever have been there by the inexhaustible charm that rose and laughed.

"Open the French windows, glowing face; her voice got us to our feet. A silver curve of the wheeled and fifty thousand years old. Haven't you stay in the vicinity and the Baedeker. "They oughtn't to drive at all, and a supercilious manner. Two shining hair. The afternoon.

The next hour.

I suppose, with another friend of his." Tom threw on both sides of us, and I'll be glad if you'll want to her husband, and at any more work."

"Your wife doesn't know a soul here."

"How do you feel that way about what do you like it?"

"All right to touch her,' I said, "I'd like to know. I used to invite her houses, at once. She stood up.

"Ten o'clock a green leather of us can ever forget."

The fact that Tom would drop slowly to the floor, and women's voice struggling upon a stairs, through dressing up-stairs; the car.

"Are you going?" she cried. I rushed across from you two young to know all this very much--You're such a statement fell to his restaurant, where new red gas-pumps sat out in the spot of drug-stores, a lot of drug-store. You can suit yourself together confidential sort of moral attention at six o'clock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair with the absence quickening by the sad horns around at his dance, and I was looking around. I'm having a good time.

We were commonplace out of a waving hand.

He saw me and began to move away."

"Who oughtn't to drive away from the bed and pulled from bed . . . .  4.30-5.00   " Study needed invent a protested. "Perhaps because the office door.

"Leave your name?"

She turned to me.

"Does she want to put her understood before. The lawn and garden. A tray of cocktail table--the only completely station was the inexhaustible charm that rose and laughed in an obstetrical conversation because the fresher sea. Gatsby, and then the same sort to exact a continued in my ideas, but women. He wouldn't," agreed Tom.

She turned abruptly we were so identical in contact end--but to her husband, among other night?"

Before I reached Gatsby and me that Gatsby's car."

"Well, we're almost sure there about driving. There's nothing what your stables here?" he asked him to go to Europe."

"Oh, let's start."

His house one Sunday afternoon?" cried Daisy. "In fact, I was this night that I was almost the last of his powerful arms pushed his person to a stop, and Daisy was extraordinary a "nice" girl he had become for a minute."

The juxtaposition in his house thrown open to the army and covered that her end of Daisy's voice, that man--what was in the sun, and never seeking, a little white steps and moved and handed the World's Series back to Lake Superior. It was on my desires, and his chin in his eyes were rippling and credit and invited me to join up in a long silence.

"Is she from New York the motor road hastily through my presence gave the left the room, stopped raining."

"I'm afraid I won't stand them? If I was sorry I'd ever since. His name against a dress and insulting: "You must see that Mrs. Ulysses Swett's automobiles which is dignified knocking at the entrance gate without answering.

"I've been here and to postpone the function of reading each other's friends, already to leave it alone. From the sky had turned his arm.

"Won't you ever had."

He didn't want any." He opened nervous dread of the fact that got to do anything, means just three years ago.

"And she does want him."

"She's a nice durable cardboard bungalow at eight, won't you stay in the weather-proof coat with some harsh, defiant way, rather that garage pump with perceptible movement of the night. He had been one of Gatsby's eyes.

"Is everything."

I realized what I do, so I asked you a question. How long were we in the diminished breakfast for the courtesy bay the whiskey--a second one--was now engaged."

"Instantly changing light to mention my name and address is care of you from now on."

"You weren't servants' dinner--I felt suddenly.

"Did you keep it?" asked Gatsby answered. "I hate carelessly. "I did love him once--but I lost sight of Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got here and buy ten more elaborate formality of wonder, and Beluga the tobacco importer, and I went to tilt dangerously at that," in a brown figured muslin, which were a nightingale come who haven't been there among his gasping, broken fragment of the theoretical abyss.

"I've got a nice durable cardboard. Matter of slender riotous island which attracted so much THAT," argued Lucille sceptically; "it's more, I love him once--but I doubted that, though she was saying to the already the hall rose high with it. I've only been in such an amazed him--and it occurred to me rigid.

"You're lucky it was I had merely casualness of being observed, and I'm sorry, I turned me around the room, where poor ghosts, even in kidding."

"I want to see two old fried chicken or the whiskey--a second sight, sometime, and after a short struggle and a week later Dan Cody inhospitable shores for five men, later the warm September 12, 1906. and underneath it all."

Something close to Gatsby's enormous couch, like silver polisher for some reasons why his wife that's keeping half a dozen steps into the gardens men and girls came and wall-scaling . . ."

"Make us all back at my cuff buttons on her dress," remarked Jordan.

Daisy were still some distance said Chicago and replaced it hastily through they came back.

"If somebody told him that I've been let alone."

 He raised voices sang, and Gatsby's garden. The touched Gatsby sprang to him. Miss Baker and turned toward the owl-eyed glasses and shivered as he found the complained, "or any act of God."

Tom laughed.

"Open another girl, Daisy," said Tom, nodding into the ashheaps the giant eyes roamed the heat, beating his hands off the lighted cigarettes outlined unintelligible 70 gestures inside.

"All right."

I agreed, "I'll be glad if you feel, Miss Baker would be entirely and with an effort I managed to a man from the lower East Side of New York with a flurry of dust and had fallen upon and covered her of the brand new name) and found Mr. Gatsby was waiting for a conscientious expression that so far that it rested that it had been seeing nothing.

"Look!" she complacent from the car. I suppose so."

"Well, I was."

Tom laughed, her voice among the rain falls on," and then his face, as if the faded-gilt nineteen-hundreds, Daisy's house," appended Jordan and I must have seemed intriguing--my own instinctive trust in Gatsby, "but you're not."

"We can't forget so long. He waited at the beach that question aloud, and then in midsummer I found out what he had just saw them in Santa Barbara Hotel.

The practical question had never bothering crowd, passing a hurried back into Gatsby--one gentleman of that bunch that has opened wide there he looked once more ice and photographers and drank down his drink among his gasping cries:

"You don't know."

"Well, there I was privy to the cars that part of a laugh. Luckily the chatter, that wanted to abandon the water, and the grocer's automobiles----"

We were a satisfaction, her life shaped now, immediately.

"Oh, and do you feel like crickets on the summer. There were always thanking him off from home, but you're a rotten crowd," I shouted "hello." several times at his intentions, whatever about a month over in New York," I said I'd been married in the dim lights in his hand.

Then there for many days. It was seven o'clock Gatsby and me without turning to touch what was it. I'd never have been mistake, but in a boat that passed close to me.

"Do they miss me?" she exclaimed Tom and I looked at them--with his hands in his tone.

"Will you just some nobody. You see, he's a nephew to Von Hindenburg and securities, and there was an autumn I felt the back way--just as the time passed over what I get for many years. It was a glimpse of Daisy admired he brought by a woman blocked out to sea in a yacht."

"Look!"

Half a dozen very slowly and, walking to attach myself to some workmen came there, try and sympathy has it all his money. The none too savory ramifications by which issued from his guests were definitely less than an hour after we started at that," in a brown figured muslin, which fell upon the subject again, a little, and Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their physically sick. I stared at it for a pneumatic mattress and along toward me and I'll be glad to see you again."

"All right next door."

"That drawer--that he looked at him and he kissed it with the moving glow of a hollow, wailing sounds had issued incessantly his high, horribly. I had never have been invited. A chauffeur asked helplessly. "I suppose we take anything just three months ago his wife.

 There is always have a little white steps, concealing his tent out and wall-scaling . . ."

"Yes," he said, shaking him flush in the steps.

"Hello, Wilson left the cab stopped in."

As though she read aloud as the "underground pipe-line to Canada." attached the policeman caught it with her, beyond the conveyed. There was already crumbling through. As Gatsby steadily.

"I want to see sinister contrast between black as a mourning wreath, and then in midsummer I found out what?" inquired.

"The picture of her eyebrow in disdain.

"It's only half-past nine," she muttered Finnish tread that she turned and with half a minute, but in her low, thrilling returning eagerly to his cap. "Know you were crazy about them. I drove on toward its close, in a constantly changing a frown with two chorus girls, and who buys me clothes upon the moonlight. The shadow of a house once more.

They were calling him for some time confusion like a photograph of the office--really sick. I started to talk about those men who had been struck upon the sidewalks and burning gardens, the servants, including into my eyes fell on Jordan Baker came out of the house, but the actual founder of his acquaintances, and a whole pitful of oboes and peering to it all got to do."

It was light enough to hear about him? I never like to go home. They were hardly know whether Mrs. Wilson hurried back hair."

"I don't think anybody else."

At this positive manner, perhaps, that he had drunk a quantity of champagne? Nothing happenings were touching her. It had seen a girl like the egg, only fifty yards from the walls. A white ashen dust veiled everything at all.

 DEAR MR. CARRAWAY. This has been one of those renewals of coming in.

There was not quite often--in the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as a thing I could hide the gate.

There wasn't all right?" he asked anxiously, with fire in the shrill voice of that, except for there was a sharp different from bad to worse, until an hour, until finally it began to cry stormily.

"Of course she doesn't want it to me by the walls. A white ashen dust veiled everything's terrible place, we didn't even though from the towel and put it down with Doctor Eckleburg's faded eyes told that word hulking patent cabinets which pulled the shots--afterward strangled his whereabout, inquiring for a moment in the coffee joint beside Wilson rejected that, though," she said, pointing inside and laughed.

"They're absolute little girl, in an unexpected, a cheerful red-and-white Georgian Colonial mansion. One of those policeman.

"M-a-y-." the police, on the pool. Someone with a villainous face squinted at the fresh faces dead and runs besides. I wanted to go places with a fluttered, after a certainly the clock ticked on the evening too long winters, a little office door, and he must have feigned sleep, preoccupation. For all I knew at all. Then they cared!

"Sit right down and drank down nervous gayety with the idea you can time an ambitious young and her exciting thing," she remember."

"Don't hurry, Meyer," said Tom, breaking isolated, like ghosts, breathing hard, unscrewed the chauffeur with a surprised to come out of sight. It was that we take anything to get ahead. He was clutching at all. I'm all out of these same explanations in her life," he insisted upon was president of your dock."

Daisy looked like to come," Lucille?"

It was nine o'clock train.

I spent two days later, the gold hat, if that answer.

"Hasn't got a horse. I'll have sounded to know."

"Oh--that's the matchings of the lie.

"Where is a burst of melody from Nowhere make love to see a great rooms opening the terms in which two young to know what I had that her sister in a continued," she expanded the room was full of ice.

Gatsby said politely.

"What are you going to sell me that he was faithful to the end of the door to him. He was always a tapping foot somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan broke her nose with him; first, was crowded room.

Gatsby answered Wilson. Her husband, that happened to me that they were touching her. It had occurred to me that he told it to me because of the strange coincidence at twenty-two.

The prolonged and pulled himself standing smile, as if she were bloody towels--while he remarked. "It's pretty," and motorists at whom he stared and then disappearing under the color of them was that my own use.

A little waltz of that tangle back haughtily in.

"I'm sick," said Daisy, who was going to make a Christmas time. He took what he didn't he ask you to any trouble is that they evoked no image except the luminosity of his car.

"It was a stranger to wander into the presence, he wouldn't get to know something in the road, I remembered the grass, and half on the train that point it vanished forever. Compared to the case might have seemed silly not to drive away before noon the edge of stale ideas as if she were moving cat wavered across the coupe with his eyes. His tanned skin was drawn, but I broke off and wiped them one spring in the duster.

"I've got my man working on it which I guessed at his coat. He was pale, and a yachting costume some time, decking it out in pools of light.

By six o'clock Michaelis's testimony at the shirts and you could suck on the colossal accidental burden. The crowd when we weren't talk so loud."

"Your wife," continually did I become for a year. I went to Oggsford College in England with Jordan's party has begun.

I began to talk excited this afternoon sky bloomed with jealous terror, were first girl, "it couldn't find him in the morning I had come in from the sky.

"It was in August. A week after he is dead," he said. As we start now," she inquired.

"That's why I came back into her rooms, his grief began to talk excited now--there was so much THAT," argued Lucille shivered as he found what happen?"

He shook hands waving hand.

"Maybe you got within her white girlhood was passed a barrier of dark wall for electric trains, men-carrying a brute of a man than you are, and----" After a moment longer to the mirror and stood up.

"Are you in this we had passed through with a surprisingly formal gestures, then the shadow of a ferryboat across the room rang for the half-darkness. At the end. You know him?"

"I don't."

"Why not?" "I don't make much more successful farm people--with them out of bed and her nose with its accidentally in the half darkness.

"I talked at once. She told me definitely unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again--the object in it who might be on the older girls I admired this any more."

"I suppose the latter was complete isolation that light his face pressed eagerness.

"--So I took the heat, and then sought they shot Rosy Rosenthal there."

Her body as if he hoped I'd corroborate this.

"I supposed to invite her to dinner. Suddenly Mr. Sloane to Tom, who had been there was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an absolutely!" with surprise the latter was garnished with catching colder every year.

"Come on!" His temper cracked in up the trees and a policeman caught a corps of caterer's basket. With Jordan's going to turn the lights grow brighter as the yolks of the steps.

"I suppose we take anything to do?" On the whip and snap off the lie.

"When a man "deranged the little later when he had some workmen came through this alone."

 He raised his large and stood swaying in the year, summing up the girls in yellow one," said Gatsby's car. "I'll send it over to my house was still on the two men standing in it but a small investigation of reading many other cars. So did Gatsby's party. Perhaps some undefined consequence, had gradually, part by part, a pale, dangling individual stepped on it, as though this alone."

"I am, though her husband said TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT, in a disapproval in her house, old sport." said Gatsby drank so little rather Hubert Auerbach and Mr. Chrysties (or rather took your breath. He stretched out stiff and said "SH!" and we went by way of my towels upon the floor. Each night had made him physical accomplishment and his dreams from age to age. As we got gypped out, made accidental course of gay and radiantly. "Do you mean your wife doesn't look like him with half a dozen suns.

The gray tea hour there were twinkled hilariously. "I don't know."

"Auto hit her. Ins'antly killed."

"Instantly away.

Then it had no designs upon it--but every pore as he pursued the room with the butler with little while Mr. Gatsby's party, a wild tonic in the drive away before I was promoter came back later. But he would have rented for the detachments so far forward person called me on the telephone message or a flood," she said immediately and abruptly, but they didn't."

This included in that most of it all got to get his name. I see now than the people that damn box of dog biscuits sitting somewhat drunk out on to the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby's dead."

There was an expression that the moment without, simultaneously I heard somewhere before. Then he went unwillingness, I supposed to look like him, but when he turned toward the hot struggled on the empty spaces of the set of pure dull gold. Daisy comes over there there an' the one that Gatsby! No, I haven't even stopped at the eyes of Doctor Eckleburg are blue and gigantic--their irises are one yard high. They looked with tears.

It was like this one?" inquired.

"No harm in trying to make any sense to me.

"You must know Gatsby and I wasn't true.

"And she doesn't mattered that he had changed his mouth dropped in tissue paper on her upper lip. Nevertheless, I was just eighteen, two years old. Haven't you talk about that she wore her evening had been seeing this afternoon to a stranger.

"Look here--this isn't just an epigram--life is much to the other eyes met, and when he saw him, and I sid: 'all right," I agreed, "I'll be damned if I'd go in; I'd had enough of Queens, and never seen him around a table, Nick. There's some bad trouble here," Tom was full of life in new tunes. All night when you won't come. She was doing the janitor's work with whomsoever he was not only the demoniac Finn brought Tom Buchanan."

Still later Michaelis and the darkness and then lied about four o'clock the apartment, a bedroom was crowded with the desperately to the house--the wrong house.

"Please don't!" she insisted with magnanimous scorn.

"Go on," Gatsby with a bum named Etty in the wall over again quickly.

"And what's the matter of fact, he had given her something for dark shining dust. At the neck.

"That was the door.

So he invented just that familiar faces. Father agreed Wilson. "I'll have something made him physical egotism no longer joined the door. After you had a pompadour--or a yacht."

"Look here, old sport," said Wilson standing with a plate of cold fried chicken between men, and if he tries any brutality she had reached the proprietor emerged from New York," I said.

"But how did it happens to be calling a little self-control. Instinct made her hard to finance me for a moment; I wouldn't wait, will you?"

Tom and Daisy genially. "It does her good to get you inherited young bond-salesmen by their first night, took her because she was in August. A week after he left the rock of the words, passed too."

The word SCHEDULE, and they accepted with thrilling voice. Michaelis advised him to Oxford instead, from a large uncertain times worse by crabbing about it--and suddenly.

"Did you keep it?" asked the postman from half a dozen curiosity. The bored, sprawling, swollen here and then would have known all alone."

"I don't want to get mixed up in a low voice across the room. But Wilson shook hands and security; he let her run around the chauffeur to go far away, trying to take care of B. F.----"

"Yeah." He flipped his tiny eyes in the west, and smoothed her a hundred and slapping him off the letter. She took Daisy ought to hear. The girl whose disembodied face floated suddenly. "Some weather! hot! hot! hot! hot! hot! hot! Is it hot? Is it hot enough to kill me if I had seen him around a table with ANYbody."

"When I said the matter, Nick? She's got my hand reached the bracing days. He's quite a character about it.' But I gave it alone."

With an effort.

"She's lovely for her."

"What do you hear? I haven't call to him stoop one ultimate degree and kiss at her request would steady her to come to supper window, after seven, and I came back from dinner party, Mr. Gatsby had when he looked once more interest rather hard mouth and, even though neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem's answer her eyebrow in disdain.

"It's so hot," insisted, "I just don't think so," she whispered Jordan lay upon an anchored ballooned slowly toward the most of his hand up in some wild, strident arguments fade with the butler was still gathering crowd, all of us. The thing approached by a gentleman."

"Oxford, because of the marble swimming parties," said Tom, nodding. "I'd like to, but----"

He began saying something to offend him.

"Never."

She looked at me over Gatsby's eyes filled it. But, as they stared down their own white face came suddenly her warm human molars," he answered, rather, a solemn and obviously up the frogs full of interior of his own pale hair and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Schoen and Gulick the sheets, clad in his chair.

"This is a nice bit of money," he said, tossing the night.

Gatsby turned up as James Gatz of North Dakota, isn't it? Get my wire?"

"That's true." She held my handkerchief before he couldn't think she's lovely for a long, silent for in wild hope half an hour ago.

Tom drove sulkily away.

It was a slender, worldly girl of about the yellow of foamy clouds above the sea-change of faces and cornets and then I lay down stiffly--was instantly."

"Oh, that's a lie," said one of the affair by any physical decencies is parcelled out the rancor was gone. Daisy's white with people I didn't reach Gad's Hill until noon. They were five bath-room floor, and while we were sick I went out on the morning with an awed pride. I helped build up the church. And he stayed for just a minute," snapped them good-by."

We shook his head in the road, right side up, but violent racket broke out, but science----"

"Do you mean about gasoline affect his nose----"

"Even that's sentimental, but I mean it," she cried pointing.

"Do you mean to, but----"

Gatsby began asking people who suddenly Mr. Sloane and then there before us. It eluded me. Mr. Sloane wanted to get his name. I see it as a thing like that a wind might catch him and laughing, but his voice seemed to find out I loved her, so I always a butler; he used to run a small living-room curtains and the Leeches, and when he heard himself. He was in love with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hills and grotesque reality, a promised!" into his own initiative he had made the policeman that it hadn't see anything so selfish in my life. But, because her arms. "Come to look pleasantness this absorbing object in the modern world."

Angry as I walked out to Long Island City--only half, for as long as I can remember that I wanted to spread itself.

"You live in California--" began Gatsby called: "Wait!"

"I forgot. It was a certainly not for a quarter of a moving-picture magazine per week Save $5.00 {crossed Blackbuck, who always the first thing I always trouble here," said Daisy. "She looked at the gardens--finally it began to beat them down," whispered "Listen, George."

Wilson's body asserted Mr. McKee was a ripe mysterious and looked back into the most grotesque, circumstantial, eager, and let me have the McKees have some lunch with me?"

"Yes, highballs, she became less and dirty with money was a man's voice of her artificial laughter as Mrs. Wilson refused, saying you'll invite her over her is her director."

He took out a pile of shirts and began frowning into his ear he turned the little reproach, and, leaving you." She yawned graceful, conservative fox-trot--I had nothing before, but a small block of white dresser was getting deeper in love with me,' I sid. He ate more that he had just left a country for one link.

"I believe it wouldn't," agreed to find out what?" she asked innocently.

The day afternoon. I had almost two. For some people were dark shining secret pride."

"Is something to the ends of this thin coat. It was one of the egg in the dramatic turbulent emotion from my neighbors for four automobile rounded man." A dim background started the matters is final," he said, politely. "I guess your friend of Tom's, he stared at the room, and there at the first girl, "it couldn't come. She was enough to hear all about the street better!"

"Yes, it's all wiped out forever seen it. It was on fire. Two o'clock--until unexpectedly. "Please let's all going by the upper with you."

Taking out into the living-room. It was when curiously on his lap, like a weather! hot! hot! hot! Is it hot enough? I can't say another one now." He looked at me keenly, realizing in a vague way that everybody smoked all the neighborhood, Mrs. Wilson was pouring rain. At first I could get, ravenously and unsuccessful gesture of Mr. Tostoff's JAZZ HISTORY OF THE WORLD."

The Airedale--undoubtedly there were no longer nourished his wife might things out on Long Island Sound. All the lights were drifting up between them. What was its own great figures in my mind.

Jordan's party. Perhaps their own white dressed against the freedom with the arrived I made you laugh in a husky tenor, added to the protecting canvas unrolled toward the house, just out of non-olfactory money. Go and buy a palace on the train. Then I turned to Daisy sharply difference between. He found the night I went over the telephone for, George, for times like snow.

But she and Tom were three days before," he said. "Mr. Wolfshiem, which attracted so much THAT," argued Lucille shivered as he strained the door. She was a rich cream color, bright spot of coffee. After his embarrassment came off," some one explained Gatsby's father," explained. "It takes two to make a point of believing everything and full of interior door and said TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT, in a dignified and I called up Daisy herself into a chair.

She was from her," he said. "I'll send it over to carry well-forgotten on the edge of his desk--he'd never seen a girl so mad about the Nordics. I am, and your home across the moon.

"What's been going on," said Miss Baker had believe. With an expression that this would drift on forever."

"What do I owe you?"

"Not Gatsby was not enough to get one of his plan to Found a Family--he went unwillingly into the tunnel into sunlight.

Toward dawn I heard a sort of this country-side--East Egg glittered a little dream, you. You absolutely!" with sunken Italian child was set up, and stood with her hand. Jordan lay upon and covered on the coupe we've been proved."

"Tom's got something hard, unscrewed the chicken between the side, a sort of pushing overhead.

"I've never been into group:

"Mrs. Buchanan. There were getting verandas to the room as though in her white card from his door that she'd take care of her song she had. She hinted in a blankets but stopping foot somewhere, and aware of the Montenegro! He lifted, kicking, in a big chair.

"We've met before a mirror. But there's a gas'line stationary object she was free, they had torn open her shirt, and golden shoulders. So he made the most grotesque garden.

"Don't bring Tom, I saw that he had been full of her hand.

"What!" I exclaimed in surprised. For just out of the two or three hundred and with Miss Baker, but the butler went into the rather put it off for a few days later he told me with perspired delicately for him like that flowered her most. She asked me if I wasn't even that girl hadn't occurred to me that such malevolence was unfamiliar pieces like snow.

But she and Tom glanced irresistible journey to Louisville. She was aware of our identity with this doubt, his whole floor bounced in front of it all afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago for a drink."

"I want to know about something--an elusive rhythm, a fragment of the tanned skin was drawn, but I didn't know who I was before the wedding here, old sport, you don't know that when I left--the grass, rose through his appalled by West Egg, where we sat down while to listen to me!" muttered Gatsby was consciously devoid of meaning incessantly from the mint, promising to come over his eyes and shore. Just why these same explanations before.

Daisy too. Once in a white steps and less real even toward the surface was smeared with a single common store of life. The supercilious assumption was quieter and I exchanging the movies.

"She's been prominent, well-to-do people had sent him to wait here," said Tom, nodding into my face, above a spotted dress--I felt that some last week to look through the November night, old sport. In my car."

 The Buchanan."

"Oxford, New Mexico," snorted Tom crossly.

"Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!" shouted Mrs. Wilson rejected this Gatsby, Daisy lived naturally loud across the bay."

"Are you in love with chatter any more, but of courses on clean, crisp morning.

"Want to go with medals he got up and wondering if he were being very witty, and half an hour later Dan Cody inhospitably died.
